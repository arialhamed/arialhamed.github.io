# Bloomberg Market Concepts

From 14 September 2023 to _TBA_, I have undertaken the Bloomberg Market Concepts course from [Bloomberg for Education](https://portal.bloombergforeducation.com), and these are my notes. 

My only gripe with this course is that there is no way for me to actually use the Bloomberg Terminal without paying multiple thousands a year, but hey that's why i'm taking these notes, specially if I ever end up working for Bloomberg. 

I'm just gonna say this: this course unveiled a huge nerd inside of me, one who loves market, finance & analysis of market & finance.
