# <span style="font-size:50%;">a Gen Z's</span> Bloomberg Market Concepts <span style="font-size:70%">Notes</span>

Ever since 14 September 2023, I have undertaken the **Bloomberg Market Concepts** course from [Bloomberg for Education](https://portal.bloombergforeducation.com), and these are my notes. 

My only gripe with this course is that there is no way for me to actually use the Bloomberg Terminal without paying multiple thousands a year, but hey that's why i'm taking these notes, specially if I ever end up working for Bloomberg. 

I'm just gonna say this: this course unveiled a huge nerd inside of me, one who loves market, finance & analysis of market & finance.

### My take on this
Ok, so it's Oct 1 today, i've done it, i've skimmed through the last 3 sections because goddamn, i thought it was hard. The last 2 modules were hard, Equity Options was the hardest imo. 

Midway through this course, I noticed that the Economic Indicators module got an update, so I spent the rest of today doing that. The only change there was are some actually great changes to the UIUX for the videos, including more controls such as playback speed and the transcript are now embedded subtitles (accessibility W fr). Why I think this is taking a while is because they also included about 5 more languages, and I know that takes a while. 

Funny enough, I was thinking of how horrible the video control was was for a multi-billion dollar company, but hey, the narrators were, well.., alright. Ok, they were too fast. I found myself having to restart each video about 4-5 times in order to absorb whatever they were saying, so imagine how appalled I was that they only gave playback speed recently and only to one module ðŸ˜µ. I can't imagine how it is for the other languages, I would have to think that the languages that has a lot of syllables would have no choice but to slow down the video. 

Ok, so criticism aside, this course awakened an economics & finance nerd in me. From what I thought was a boring topic became one that resonates well with my personality to find the optimal solution, creating many ideas, knowing how to individualize and communicate to others, and have that drive to keep up with the world! I don't keep up with the world because I am being pushed to do it, I aim to run ahead because the gains in the end is pulling me!
