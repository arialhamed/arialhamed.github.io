# Relative valuation
Basically comparison to another company. This is not to calculate an exact fair share price, but rather to calculate if a company is undervalued, overvalued, or fairly valued. 

Relative valuation contains 2 steps:
1. Metrics
	- Dividend Yield
	- P/E
1. Application
	- Self
	- Peers
	- Market

### Dividend Yields
This are regular steady payments to shareholders, usually in cash. Kinda like fixed income, butttt: 
- Dividends payments may vary while bond payments usually do not. 
	- You can find dividend amount in Dividend/Split Summary (`DVD`). I agree with the narrator that coke is basically sugar water ewww.
- Dividend yields are easier to calculate than bond yields. There is no concept of maturity to equities. 
	- Dividend yields are calculated by dividend per share divide by price per share.

### Price to earnings ratio
The reciprocal of an earnings yield is the P/E ratio. This is calculated by price per share divided by earnings per share. 

This is just maths. 

### Use of P/E ratios in valuation
P/E ratios are good in relative valuation. If you have an earnings estimate and a fair P/E ratio, then calculating the estimate market cap would be a piece of caaaake

E x (P/E) = P  
IT'S BASIC MATHEMATICS

This framework shows if share prices may go up:
- Earnings growth: If E goes up, P goes up
- Multiple expansion: If P/E goes up, P goes up

### Relative valuation versus self
How has the metric become over time? How is it with competitors? How is it compared to the market?

Share prices alone does not give a full picture of valuation.  
Always look at P/E multiples in the context of earnings. 

### Relative valuation versus peers
This is what most people understand by Relative Valuation. Which companies are truly peers? Those that operate in the same industry & region, aka direct competitors.  
Here is a problem tho: 
- A peer may have multiple industries. but only 1 P/E ratio are given to each peer. P/E ratios are not seperate for their different industries. 
- A peer may be private, which means no share price, which means no share price. 

You can find a company's relevant peers in Relative Valuation (`RV`). 

A company's P/E ratio may appear dramatically high compared to it's peers, so this is where the versus market comes in

### Relative valuation versus market
This is easy. Just go to the World Equity Index (`WEI`). 

### Valuation of the market & How the economy drives the stock market
This E x (P/E) = P is why the stock market is so volatile. Overall, company earnings drive the market. Check it out in the SPX index in `GF`. 

Should i put my savings into equities? 

Here's yet another snag! An equity is influenced on the country's GDP. There is also much more factors such as time, technology, people, etc.

## Summary 


































Relative Valuation
- Relative valuation is the quick and easy comparison of one valuation to another.
- The risk of relative valuation is being led astray by unrealistic reference points. 
- Earnings and multiple are used to estimate fair share prices. 
- Fast growing companies warrant high multiples and vice versa. 
- The state of the economy is a key driver of relative valuation.

## Here are the 5 key takeaways from equities
1. Index movements are driven by movements in member stocks
	- Major movements and heavily weighted stocks exert a stronghold upon an index
1. The volatility of earnings leads to volatility & high potential upside of share prices
1. Uncovering industry drivers is key to estimating accurate earnings
	- Market sizing, market share analysis, interplay between industry & company performance
1. Absolute valuation is in theory perfect but has practical limitations
	- You require clairvoyance. 
1. Relative valuation is easier but sensitive to earnings growth
