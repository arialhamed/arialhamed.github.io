# The Nature of Equities
What on earth is equities? It is basically if bonds gave residual cash flow (whatever is produced after all other expenses are paid in a company). 

### Difference between bonds & equities
Bond holders -> FIXED  
Equity holders -> RISKAY  
Equity is basically if fixed income were dependant on the performance of the borrower. 

### Rights of bond holders and shareholders, and stock market volatility
Bonds are a guarantee, but equity does not (no promises in equities).  
Equities are an all or nothing thing, like a rollercoaster, or Arin Hanson

dayum this is pretty straightforward after going through what was thought in the previous modules. 

### Returns from dividends
equity has dividends, which are the residual cash that a company has after taxes.  
Indices (such as s&p 500) ignores dividends. Note that DIVIDENDS ARE VALUABLE. 

### Volatility comparison
If dividends are reinvested, then there is significantly larger returns from equities compared to bonds. 

### Factors to consider when comparing returns 
Remember, INFLATION. Inflation & nominal returns must be equal for one to stand still. 

### Returns matrix
finally some good shit  
Bonds:
- Downside: Everything, if the borrower defaults, but receives repayments before it 
- Upside: Everything, if the bonds are held to maturity, the yield is earned that is calculated when bought
Equities:
- Downside: Everything, if company is fallen, and no collateral recovery
- Upside: Unlimited, if company is doing good and spicy

This is illustrated in Member Ranked Returns (`MRR`). 

With equities, you can only lose 100%, but you can earn 1000%

### Section Quiz
- Why are equities volatile
	- Due to the residual nature of earnings
	- Shareholder dividends are paid out from earnings. Fluctuations in both revenue and costs lead to fluctuations in what is left to pay shareholder dividends, that is, earnings. It is high levels of borrowing which do, in fact, make equities more volatile. 
- Which uhhhhh
	- When you buy an equity, the most you can lose is 100% and your potential gain is unlimited. 
	- If a company in which you own shares goes bankrupt, your share certificates are worthless, meaning you lose 100%. If, on the other hand, you own shares in a company which goes on to succeed spectacularly, the earnings - and, therefore, the share price - may multiply. Dividends by their nature are decided periodically and are not promised by company management. A typical bond promises a series of fixed repayments, as opposed to a portion of the residual income of that company. 
- Company A pays a dividend of 2%. Company B's stock price increases 1% plus the inflation rate every year. Company C pays 3$ dividends, and its stock price decreases every year by 2%. Company D pays 0% dividends, and its stock price does not increase year over year. If the companies are otherwise identical, which would you invest in? 
	- Company B
	- Average inflation in the U.S. is 2% per year, which makes the stock price increase of Company B equal to 3%. Three percent is higher than Company A at 2%, Company C at 1%, and Company D at 0%. 
- You buy the stock of four consumer goods companies in March 2014 and hold them for five years until March 2019. Here are the TRA (Total Return) charts from Bloomberg for all four stocks. The "Buy Price" in the top left-hand corner is the price you paid for each stock. The price of the stock in March 2019 is noted in the chart's legend. The legend also states the Dividend Adjusted Value of the stock in March 2019, which is the value of the stock including reinvested dividends over the holding period. For which stock did the bulk of the total return come from dividends? 
	- Colgate-Palmolive
	- The total return of Colgate-Palmolive was 16.6% (74.45 - 63.83). The return from only price appreciation was 4.1% (66.45 - 63.83). Therefore the return from dividends was the difference of 12.5% (16.6% - 4.1%). Therefore the total return from dividens was 75.3% (12.5% / 16,6%) which is highest. 

## Summary
The Nature of Equities
- Shareholders own a share of company earnings and assets. 
- Stocks are volatile because earnings are volatile.
- Shareholder returns come from both shares going up and payments of dividends. 
- The range of shareholder outcomes is assymmetrical. Shares can go to zero or can multiple in value.
