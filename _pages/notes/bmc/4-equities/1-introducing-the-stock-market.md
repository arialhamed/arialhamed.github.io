### Stock market volatility & crashes
Equities, stocks & shares == part ownership of a company.  
It is hard to predict, once someone said that it was going to plateau, but then the stock market fell about 88%.  
19 October 1987 was Black Monday, where the stock market crashed, hard. The New York Stock Exchange installed circuit breakers, which halted trading after a 7% decline, which gave time traders to reconsider. Even though we had 7 weekdays called black and these circuit breakers, it didn't do jacks***. 

### Purpose of the stock market
So what good do they do? They allocate resources to productive enterprises. Here are 2 reasons: 
1. Stock market makes it easy to go in and out from company investments
1. Bonds provide low yields, owning a share of a company typically earns you the underlying commercial returns of the company. 

### Charging Bull
Some statue of a bull was created in New York. It symbolizes New York's drive & optimism. The sculpture was so optimistic, they put it right in front of the New York Stock Exchange HQ. I highly doubt Bloomberg will ask you about this anymore than those lovely fish tanks.

### Total market value
Equities (65 trillion, 71338 active equities), are smaller than bonds (1O1 trillion, 2.1 million active bonds)  
Listed equities tend to be the larger corporations. Samsung is about 17% of South Korea's exports. 

### Initial Public Offerings	
Reasons to go public?
- Raise money to expand business
- Enable owners to sell their steaks to the public
- Or both

When a company becomes public, the owners become happy because they cash in a lot, or do they??

### Delistings
A company can have certain reasons:
- bought by private equity fund
- management becomes stressed with regulatory burden of being a public company
- company went poopy
- company's industry went dead (kodak)

Just like how IPOs may have good or bad aftermaths, delistings may be good or bad as well.  
A company can be delisted when it is bought, just like Whole Foods under Amazon. 

In the U.S., the number of listed companies have gone down, that means delisting > ipos

### Market monitoring
Stocks go up and down. TIL google has a parent company. Market monitoring can be done with indices. 

### Indices, index composition, index membership criteria, index weight, index move contribution

### Section Quiz
- Why do company manager-owners smile when they ring the stock exchange bell at their IPO?
	- An IPO reveals the value of the manager-owners stake. 
	- An IPO puts a dollar value on the manager-owners' stak, demonstrating what their hard work and investment is worth. A manager-owner may be selling a stake in the company at the IPO, but not necessarily. Equally, the company may just be raising funds for expansion. It would be profoundly odd for a manager-owner to ring the bell on his or her last day as the company would be losing a leader at the time when the ownership is changing. 
- The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index has an unusual weighting methodology. Unlike the S&P 500, it is weighted by share price. Here are 20 of the 30 members of the Dow Jones on March 20, 2019. If all the shares went up by 5%, which share on the screen shown would have the biggest contribution to an upward movement in the Index?
	- Goldman Sachs
	- The company with the highest share price shown on this screen is Goldman Sachs. Apple has the highest market cap on this screen: $880B. Apple's share prices is lower than that of Goldman Sachs, however.
- In 1999, James Glassman and Kevin Hassett published a book called "Dow 36,000." At the time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index was just under 12,000. Which of the following is a potential subtitute for the book title? 
	- "The Sum of the Share Prices of All 30 Dow Jones Members Will Triple"
	- The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index is calculated by adding together the share prices of the 30 constituent companies. 
- Here is a chart of the index value for the S&P 500 and the United Kingdom's main equity index, the FTSE 100, from the end of 2008 to early 2015. THe labels have been removed. One index has clearyl outperformed the other. Over this period, there was a technology boom and an oil crash. Here are pie charts showing the early 2015 index compositions by industry for both the S&P 500 and the FTSE 100. Which index outperformed? 
	- The S&P 500 Index
	- As of early 2015, energy stocks accounted for about 14% of the FTSE 100 but only 8% of the S&P 500. Technology stocks accounted for only 4% of the FTSE 100 but 20% of the S&P 500. THerefore, the technology boom was a tailwind for the S&P 500 while the oil crash was a headwind for the FTSE 100. Thus, the S&P 500 outperformed the FTSE 100.
