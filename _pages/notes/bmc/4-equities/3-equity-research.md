# Equity Research
How does investors analyze and understand what a company does?

### Equity Ownership
Shareholders own:
- The earnings of company after expenses
- The sum total of company assets that are not owed to lenders

### Volatility of Earnings
Fixed income are preordained like a monsoon, whereas equities are like volcanic eruptions. 

An income statement (found in `FA`) shows the top line (**Revenue**), to the bottom line (**Net Income**).  
Earnings = Revenues - Costs  
Is it any easier to understand this, like c'mon. 

Revenues and Costs are variable. The volatility for both influences the volatility of earnings, which is what is given in equities

### Earning Announcements
Companies typically report revenue, costs & earnings quarterly. This can be found in the Earnings Calendar (`EVTS`), aka Events Calendar. This is where shareholders know whether or not a company is doing well. 

Just like economic indicators, earnings announcements are scheduled in advance. 

### Earnings Season
It's different for each company.

### Estimating Earnings
- Industry Classification. 
	- Revenue & costs differ per company's industry. 
	- Some companies operate across multiple industries. 
	- Industry Hierarchy. 
		- Imagine the Animal Kingdom. The most granular industries are equivalent to species. 
	- Market Sizing. 
		- You can find this in the Classification Browser (`ICS`). 
	- There are over _2000_ distinct industries. 
- Suppliers & Buyers. 
	- Suppliers differ wildly per industry AND target demographic. 
	- Analysts can forecast potential supplier problems, such as:
		- Bankruptcy
		- Product problems
		- Currency movements
	- Micron is both the company, supplier & customer. 
		- Raw materials companies are Micron's suppliers. 
		- Customers are typically tech companies. 
- Revenue Projections. 
	- How big the pizza? 
	- How is the pizza divided in its revenue? 
- Cost Base. 
	- Analysts would like to know which costs are:
		- fixed
		- variable
		- labor
		- exposed to commodity prices
	- In a wind turbine's total costs, 
		- the rotor costs 24.6%, 
		- the drive train costs 56.0%, and
		- the tower costs 18.3%

### Historic Analysis
Once the industries are identified, historic performance/numbers (aka the "actuals") can be modelled by an analyst, which then can be used to project & estimate earnings. 

An analyst would simply find company events (`EVT`) to pickup the context about a company's performance. 

### Industry Drivers
Oh gosh this again.  
This is where a lot of errors occur. Analysts can accidentally build elaborate models, that miss the point. 

Known surprising underlying drivers:
- pandemic -> air travellers
- high wall street bonuses -> jewelry sales
- radioactive leaks -> wheat prices
- booming stock markets -> RV sales
- smoking -> pacemaker
- more middle class -> more meat? -> more fertilizer

A company may have multiple drivers (duhhh), though the drivers may all be very unrelated, so that's the hard part. 

### Estimating revenue and costs
I mean, this one just lookup lorh, should be public, or easily findable in the Bloomberg Terminal. 

### Beats, misses, turning points
The differences between the results & estimates are surprise:
- The actual above means beats
- The actual below means misses  
This appears in the headlines of a news story

Analysts are not infallible, they usually fail at finding out turning points. This is somehow successfully done by certain companies, so they usually lead the benchmark. An example who did good is Apple, while an example who did bad is Blackberry. 

### Surprises move share prices
As shown in S&P 500, surprises move share prices. In Earnings Analysis (`EA`) price reaction. the right means positive surprise, vice versa. If above horizontal, means shares went up, vice versa. 

However, you can see that the points are all over the chart, including the top-left & bottom-right. It involves this thing called [valuation](/notes/bmc/4/3). 

### Section Quiz
At this point, i've decided to do a systematic scrape of the content, including all interactive parts. That would be available soon. 

## Summary
Equity Research
- Analysis must know the industries in which a company operateas
- Industry estimates are foundational to a company financial model
- Industry drivers help formulate earnings estimates 
- Investors assess company results by comparing them to estimates
