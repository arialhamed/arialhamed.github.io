# The Yield Curve & Why It Matters
The yield curve is the yield visualized, duhhh

### Defining the yield curve
Go the `WB`. While here, enter `GC` . Here you can see the yield-to-bond-maturity graph for the actives in US Treasury.  
The longer maturity bonds equals to bigger yields, because: 
- more risk for the borrower defaulting, and
- more vulnerable to the corrosive effect of inflation. 

About that last one, check out the inflation forecast in Economic Forecasts, `ECFC`. Oh imagine the uncertainty over 30 years!!

### Term Premium
The differences are also known as Term Premium. 

### Bond yield forecasts
`ECFC` shows the economic forecasts, `FXFC` shows the currency pair estimates, Bon Yield Forecasts (`BYFC`) shows the bond yield forecats. 

### Ripple effects of the yield curve
The yield curve may seem obscure, but nahhh. It estimates the cost of borrowing. It influences quite a lot in the world as well. The following are the yield curve transmission mechanism in:
- Corporate Impact
	- All corporate investments are usually multi-year, so it's long year. Higher yields expected. 
	- Corporates are typically less credit-worthy than the government, so higher yields expected.
	- The spread between a company to gov between 2 different years, it would show that the spread is about the same. When a company borrows and uses it for a project, the ✨gdp grows✨.
	- During the 2008 recession, investors were worried about companies going bankrupt, so the corporate bond prices went down and yields went up. Investors also invested more into investments with no credit risk, such as U.S. government bonds, so that caost government bond prices to go up and yield swent down. A slowdown in economic activity is typically linked to deflation. 
- Consumer Impact
	- HOUSE. 30 YEAR MORTGAGE. FURNITURE, PAINT, CARPETS, STUFFED TOY RACCOONS, BLAHAJS
	- wow that was a short section lol
- Global Impact
	- Government bond yields and world economies seem to be in sync. 
	- whoa that was even shorter lol

### Section Quiz
- What does it mean when a company's corporate spread tightens?
	- The company's bonds are outperforming the benchmark yield. 
	- Spread tightening means the yield of corporate bond is much closer to the risk-free government bonds, Tightening leads to outperformance. A tightening corporate spread is a vote of confidence in the company. It will make the cost of borrowing come closer to that of the risk-free borrowing of the government. This enchances the company's ability to borrow. 
- What are the three main transmission mechanisms by which the yield curve affects the economy.
	- Corporate impact, global impact, consumer impact
	- The three main transmission mechanisms are corporate impact, global impact, and consumer impact. The principle relevance of housing is that yields regulate the cost, and therefore attractiveness, of taking out a mortgage to buy -- not rent -- a house. The yield curve indirectly affects trade by first affecting the confidence of corporations and consumers. 
- What is the 10-year to 3-month term premium of the following yield curve?
	- 0.079%
	- The table at the bottom of the chart provides the yield at various points in time along the yield curve. If we take the difference (the spread) between the 10Y yield of 2.498% and the 3M yield of 2.419%, we get the 10Y-3M term premium. 10Y yield - 3M yield = 2.498% - 2.419% = 0.079%.
- The purchase of which of the following products is most affected by interest rates?
	- Apartment
	- A home, such as an apartment, is often the most expensive item people will buy in their lifetime. Almost all home purchases are made in part with borrowed money. Motorcycles are typically less expensive than apartments, and many people choose to save up the cash to buy motorcycles, meaning that interest rates are less relevant. Cruises and season tickets are frequently paid for out of short-term cash savings, meaning that interest rates are less relevant. 

## Summary
The Yield Curve and Why It Matters
- The yield curve represents the cost of borrowing for variouse loan lengths. 
- Yield curves are naturally upwardly sloping due to elevated risk of long-term lending. 
- Corporate bonds are priced using a spread off the government yield curve so the yield curve indirectly regulates company funding. 
- Consumer borrowing for big-ticket items is priced off the yield curve. 
- Yields of developed economies are correlated, which means that the overall movements in yields has a gloval impact.
