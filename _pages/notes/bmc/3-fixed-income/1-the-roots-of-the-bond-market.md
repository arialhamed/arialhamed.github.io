# The Roots of the Bond Market
Fixed income is just another word for the bond market. Its where the price is set for borrowing & lending to governments, businesses & consumers  
Here are what we'll go through:
- The roots of the bond market (origins)
- Bond valuation dirvers (keeps it going)
- Central bankers and interest rates (who and why interest rates)
- The yield curve and why it matters (the curve)
- Movements in the yield curve (how & why)

### Size of the bond market
aight, got to Fixed Income Search (`SRCH`). here you can look at how big it is. It's about 101 trillion. Larger than the world GDP, which is about 79 trillion, and about 5 times as large of the US bond market (14T from gov, 8T from corporate, 22T for US). 

### History of the bond market
Just like the fx market, it was quite recent. It was born out of interest rate liberatilization, and removal of capital controls, which made it easier for governments to borrow.

A biggest segment of the world bond market is the government bond market, aka the sovereign debt market. Government spending has risen quite a lot to pay for healthcare, education, and other public services. 

### Government budget deficits
ok, so let's look at what US has in Budget (`BUDG`). The orange is spending, the white is tax. If the orange is higher than white, the government has spend more than it could. It may seem bad if there is much more deficit than surplus, but hey, France has always had deficits since the 70s.

During the Clinton years, the US had quite a lot of surprise due to the post-Cold War peace dividend, and taxes from the .com boom. However, in the 2008 financial crisis, it had the largest deficit of any country in history. 

### Government indebtedness. 
Go to Treasury Securities (`TSECTOTL`), and `GP` it. This shows the total amount of US gov debt, according to the fed reserve. 

### Foreign owners of government debt
Go to Sovereign Debt Ownership (`DEBT`). Click on Foreign holders tab, then the Pie Chart subtab. Now we know who owns them bonds. Why is there a lot of bonds?  
2 of the reasons are because of currency:
- Most countries currencies are floating, so they have to accumalate buy buying US bonds to keep their pegs. 
- Also, countries buy US bonds to purposely weaken their currency. 

Countries that need fx reserves use US treasuries as a safe place to put money in. US Gov bonds are widely viewed as the safest financial asset on Earth. The US is able to tax the people & businesses a lot. like a lot.  
The US can also print the USD.  
Conveniently, fx reserves are also denominated in USD.  
US is the piggy bank. 

Go to International Reserve Assets (`WIRAWRLD`) then `GP`. There is an obvious relationship between the Total world FX reserves to the amount of US gov bonds held by foreign countries.

Remember, investors, both in & out of US, uses US gov bonds as well. You can check out the Volatility Index (`VIX`). The higher it is, the more fearful investors are. 

### Corporate bonds
Corporate bonds are the 2nd largest sector besides US gov bonds. Unlike the US government, there is much variety corporate bonds. 

Why do companies borrow in the corporate bond market?
- A discrepancy in tax treatment means that debt repayments lower a company's bill by reducing pre-tax profits through interest payments. Being financed in debts saves a company money
- Companies can borrow money for a longer term from the government compared to banks (not so keen on long-term loans for companies)

### The structure of a bond
A bonds is basically a note that promises to:
- make regular fixed amount payments, **coupons**, that has _no compounding interest_. 
- pay at the end of the loan, called **principle**. 

You can go a country's bonds (`DDIS`), looking at how repayments for debt is done. The rigidity in the repayments gives rise to the term <span style="font-size: 300%;">fixed income</span>  
For a 10-year bond, a foreign bond holder will issue a "note" to the US gov with sum of money. The US will pay the foreign bond holder a fixed interest of the 10-year period, then repay the original amount after the bond ends. 

### Introducing bond yields
bond yields are calculated based on how much money is paid AND what is the interest rates. To put simply what the boring narrator said, the Annual Percentage Rates (APR) will change depending on how much prospective bond holders pay. 

APR is not the one that changes. The word FIXED is in the repayments over the schedule, given that the bond issuer doesn't default on it.  
APR IS YIELD. 

Usually, the APR is inversely proportionate to the price of the bond, kinda like barley cordial in cold water. The higher the price, the lower the rate, where as the lower the price, the higher the rate. 

This applies when a new investor wants to issue a bond but there is already bonds in the government. If a yield goes up, the coupons still remain the same for the existing bonds, which will be same as the coupons for new bonds. However that means new bonds mean that prices will go down.  
That happens vice versa, where if the yield goes down, the coupons will still be the same but new investors will need to pay more for the same coupon as those who has bonds with a higher yield. THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED YIELD. 

### Winners & losers from bond yields
When yields are high, lenders (the bondholder) are happy because their return is high, and borrowers are sad because they have to pay high.

and vice versa

### Knowledge check stuff
The US has the rifht to tax the wealthiest population on Earth (lol like that's happening)  
SERVICING DEBT - this means to sustaining one's existing amount of borrowing by paying coupons.
