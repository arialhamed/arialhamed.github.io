# Movements in the Yield Curve
Yield curves are driven by short-term interest rates & inflation, and credit-worthiness does not. 

### The yield curve in motion
So imagine a jack connected to a balloon. The balloon moves when the FOMC meetings (jack) changes the rates. 

### Movements in left-hand end of yield-curv
It's the Federal Fund's target rate. 

### Movements in right-hand end of yield-curve
Long-term yield drivers
- Interest rate forecasts
- Long-term GDP growth estimates
- Demographics
- Demand for long-term borrowing 
- Supply of long-term lending
- Inflation expectations. 

Left-hand end of yield curve is influenced by **interest rates**, whereas the right-hand end is strongly influenced by **inflation expectations**

### Predicting yield curve movements
Here are 2 key indicators:
- `WIRP` left hand
- `ILBE` right hand

Guessing both ends boils down to guessing the **gradient** of the yield curve.  

### Steep yield curve
yo so the right end (long-term interest rates), is set by unconstraint bond trading. Bond investors expresses their views for future believes. 

### Flat yield curve
This happens when interest rates become very high and short term. Investors believe that the rates will drop again fast. They knew that the yields go down when the rates go down, and the prices would go up, hence they bought long-term bonds often. That would cause the yield curve to be flat. 

### Inverted yield curve
When interest rates halts, investors would buy more long-term bonds. Since the left hand of the yield curve is locked with the federal fund interest rate, the graph becomes inverted as interest rates on the right becomes lower than that of the federal fund. This is not natural. 

When the investors dropped so down, the credit crunchie happened. 

### The yield curve as an economic indicators
Quite good economic indicator, as long as you know about fixed income first. 

The term premium is negative when the yield curve is inverted. This happened 7 times in the US
- First Oil Crisis
- Second Oil Crisis
- Early 80s Recession
- Early 90s Recession
- Dotcom Bust
- Great Recession
- The only false positive that happened was the Russia Crisis. Very important to take note. 

The `GC3D` function gives a 3D graph curve to visualize how the yield curve changes through time. You can ride sick waves bruhhhh. 

### Section Quiz
- What is the primary driver of the left-hand end of the yield curve? 
	- Central bank interest rates
	- The far left of the yield curve is linked to the overnight interest rate of the central bank. The other three factors are the key drivers of the far right end. 
- Which of the graphs most clearly represents investors predicting a down turn in the economy?
	- A, the one with the inverted yield graph
	- When an economy is booming, investors expect rates to go up in order to rein in inflation. The right-hand end of the yield curve will immediately reflect this with higher yields while the left-hand end will remain trapped in the present with the current lower level of rates, representing a steep yield curve. Investors predicting a downturn in the economy will buy the right-hand end of the yield curve with the view that the central bank will raise interest rates affeting the left-hand end of the yield curve, resulting in flattening or investion, as shown in A. 
- The two yield curves in the chart are from September 10, 2001 (yellow line) and from Octorber 10, 2001 (green line). What do you think the Federal Reserve did with interest rates in the month following the attacks of September 11, 2001?
	- Cut interest rates
	- In the month after the attacks of September 11, 2002, the Federal Reserve cut rates in order to calm the financial markets. This explains why the left-hand end of the yield curve went down by a full percentage point over the month. 
- Look at the below yield curve inversion chart. What is most likely to happend as a result of the most recent yield curve inversion shown?
	- GDP will dip
	- If curve inversion is a sign of recession, we'd expect the GDP to go lower or negative. Investion of the yield curve also reflects the compression of term premium, so term premium would go down. 

## Summary 
Movements in the Yield Curve
- The far left of the yield curve is the overnight interest rate set by the central bank. 
- The far right of the yield curve is dreiven primarily by inflation expectations. 
- While the left-hand end of the yield curve is locked, the right-hand end floats freely. 
- A steep yield curve signals improving times. 
- A flat yield curve signals worsening times. 
- An inverted yield curve often precedes a recession.

# Last note for chapter
- The bond markets keep governments accountable
- Bond yields are dirven by creditworthiness, inflation, and interest rateas
- Central banks guard against both inflation and deflation
- Central banks influence all borrowing costs via the yield curve
- Changes in the shape of the yield curve can presage turning points in the economy 

It's never good to be in debt, as the bond market is all about borrowing & lending. Ironically, there is nothing fixed about fixed income. Ben Frank once said "time is money", and nothing says it more than fixed income.
