# Monitoring GDP
Real GDP growth is painstakingly calculated. After a quarter finishes, it still takes a month for primary calculations to be released. The reports are ironically are not terribly useful. More frequent & timely indicators allows investors to keep track of GDP growth more closely, as it is more closer (duh). This is how to guess GDP

### Timeline of economic releases
In Jan 1, take a look at World Economic Calendar (`WECO`). Here you can see a list of economic indicators to be released in chronological order after Jan 1. 

PMI is released on 1 business day of the following, February. This well tell us about US Business Confidence in that year.  
The columns:
- Actual: Published economic indicator value
- Survey (Median): Median estimates from analysts of the economic indicator upon release

If the actual exceeds the estimate is higher, it's a pleasant surprise, and vice versa. 

Change in non-farm payrolls are also recorded monthly, released after PMI. 

Housing Starts should be released about halfway through Feb. 

Inflation (CPI) comes out monthly as well, after Housing Starts. 

This will continue to go on monthly, except GDP.

GDP is released every quarter, a month after the end of the quarter (so about April). 

### The value of economic indicators

You can see many examples where there is a large correlation between the other indicators with GDP, and since GDP is released less often, people will tend to depend and give disproportionate attention to the other indicators. 

It was once said that former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan would use PMI as the one statistic he would completely operate on to conduct US policy if he were stranded on a desert island. 

## Summary

Monitoring GDP:
- GDP estimation by governments is a time-consuming, periodic activity.
- GDP arrives too late to be useful to investors. 
- Instead, investors glean GDP growth through more time indicators (such as PMI)
