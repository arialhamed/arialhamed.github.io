# The Primacy of GDP

The usual way to measure any economy is GDP, which is an economic indicator.  

### The origins of GDP
Growth in GDP provides the backdrop for financial markets. 

Type WORLD GDP in cmd, select the relevant dataset, chart it with `GP`, then set the priod. Should show growth. 

In this module, we will use a large developed economy with well-established indicators so that we can understand how investors gauge economic health. We'll just use US for now. 

A state of the nation is a main unit of economic statistics. For the US, some examples that caused bad economic downturn was policy failures that caused the Great Depression. WWII also incentivised the need for better economic data so that the can have better manufacturing and resource management. 

GDP calculation in many instances is still a work in progress.
- Italy including the black market
- Nigeria saw booming new industries such as Nollywood
- US identified tech spending (because it was becoming more essential to the economy)

### Economic Statistics
There are a lot of this. There is sooo much economic indicators, and also certain indicators that are more important to different countries than another. 

Personal consumption takes about a large portion of the US GDP (about 2 thirds). Analyzing trends in consumer spending & macro-economic influences are important for those who want to invest in a certain country. 

### Essential Economic Indicators
- Economic Growth
- Inflation
- Unemployment
- Business Confidence
- Housing

### Economic Growth
It is the broadest, most comprehensive barometer of economic activity.

```
	GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
```
- C = personal consumption
- I = private investment
- G = government consumption
- X = exports
- M = imports
- (X-M) = net exports

In `ECST`, you can look at a country's GDP breakdown, listed as such.

The first thing any investor wants to know the percentage change in GDP from 1 year to the next.  
Using nominal GDP does not reveal the whole story however, because inflation is almost always positive. Nominal growth will always be greater than real growth. 
- Investors looking at the UK economy in 1975 might have been impressed by the 24% growth rate, but it also has inflation rate of 24%, so the real GDP growth rate is 0%. 

Looking at the line graph of an economy, you may see parts where the line goes below zero? If the lines is below zero for 2 succesive quarters (6 months), that's called a <span style="font-size:200%;">recession</span>. 

### Inflation
Fixed income investors takes a hard look at inflation, because it erodes the value of bonds.

What is inflation? It is the general increase in the prices of goods and services, which will lead to dimishing the purchasing power of money. One day 1 dola is less than 1 dola. Deflation is almost never thing that happens. 

For the US, there are 2 primary sources of inflation data (both monthly):
1. PCE Report (Personal Consumption Expenditures) 
	- Monitors price changes in consumer goods & services
	- Also shows what consumers are spending their income on
	- Closely watched by the Feds
1. CPI Report (Consumer Price Index)
	- Based on representative basket of goods & services
	- To be accurate it must be truly representative of spending habits in that country. 

Times change, tastes change, technologies change. What a representative baskets looks like today may not be what the representative basket may look like tomorrow. 

### Unemployment
Consumer spending is driven by salaries (duh). Investors do care about unemployment (in a certain way). It is the most political number, because unemployed people are most likely to vote the current president/prime minister out of office. 

Type in US REAL GDP GROWTH (GDP CYOY index of GDP US) -> chart -> several decades -> non-farm payrolls. If you add recession to the graph you can find that as economy shrinks, employment declines. 

### Business Confidence
Individual business leaders decide more for their business than consumers. They are willing to hire more people if they feel that there will be additional demand for their goods & services in the future. 

Institute of Supply Management in Arizona has the most widely followed index of US manufacturing activity: the Purchasing Manager's Index. For a long while they have been regularly surveying people-in-charge of buying goods and services for corporations about business conditions. pretty simple
- more than 50 -> positive
- less than 50 -> negative

Type in PMI INDICATOR, find the one under ISM Manufacturing PMI -> chart it -> overlay GDP growth. Quite a strong relationship, unlike jeff bezos' relationship. 

### Housing
Housing starts is stronger than house building. Even though it is about 3% of the US economy, its still quite strong because of:
- home owners need to have confidence to assume a 30-year mortgage
- the many, many, many factors in a house, i ain't gonna list it here.

Plotting housing starts against GDP growth, there is also a relationship

## Summary
- Real GDP growth is the main guage of economic health. 
- Economic growth is cyclical, with a series of booms and busts. 
- Investors interpret the conomy through economic indicators. 
- Leading indicators attract the most investor interest.
