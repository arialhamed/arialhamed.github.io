Create new login, follow the promps, welcome! You should get an autogenerated login name (i.e arihamed02 is the login name, arihamed02@bloomberg.net is your bloomberg email)  

### Panels

There are 4 bloomberg windows, all of which are the same, which allows you to "multitask"

In each window, there are 3 main sections
- Toolbar
- Command line
- Function area

Functions are applications that provide
	- Targeted information
	- Analysis, on either
		- Broad financial market
		- Specific security

The HELP command, like, really helps

- Pressing <span style="color:#50A120;">F1</span> or <span style="color:#50A120;">Help</span> twice connects to Bloomberg support
- <span style="color:#50A120;">Message</span> sends & receives messages (between Bloomberg Terminal users?)
- <span style="color:#50A120;">News</span> shows today's top news

### Finding information
![](https://github.com/arialhamed/static/blob/main/images/notes/bmc/1-1-5.png?raw=true)

There are 2 main ways to find information
- The Command Line
	- Typing keywords will suggest auto-completes to potential functions & securities, here you can select one to start
	- You can also run a specific function in the command line
		- The auto-complete will show the Mnemonic (i.e. the Mnemonic of "World Equity Index" is `WEI`)
	- You can also get info on securities
		- The stock-taker with the Equity label will show the company's stock
			- When loaded, you will see the security-specific functions
		- The stock-taker with the Corp label will show the company's debt
	- Above the command line, there are 3 grey buttons
		- Reference for past securities loaded
		- Recent functions executed
		- Navigate the terminal via Bloomberg's menu system
- The Menu System
	- Browse all Bloomberg functions organized by asset class and common activities
	- Clicking on the white house (not the building) icon will start on Main Menu, the homepage
	- To the left, it is the asset classes. That will show some other functions
	- When you are in a function, hit the Menu key, and it will show a Menu of related functions
		- Clicking on the white house will go back to the Home Menu
		- Clicking on cancel will go back to the function you were on

### Getting help
