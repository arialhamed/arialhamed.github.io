# A PM's career
This is just from junior to senior, from one value to multiple value

# Investment strategies
For now, imagine that value stocks outperform growth stocks. Your company gives you a high value mandate (like 400mil). Before that, let's go through these kinds of stocks:
- Value stocks
	- Low P/E ratio, high dividend yield
	- These kinds of companies are often neglected, so a manager that chooses value stocks goes against the grain
- Growth stocks
	- High P/E ratio, low dividend yield
	- These companies don't have the history to backup their potential, so its technically higher risk
- GARP (growth at a reasonable price) stocks
	- The middle ground between the 2

### How a pension plans invests
As a PM, pension plans and insurance companies are the main asset owners of your fund. 
- Pension plan wants to invest
- Plan hires investment consultant
- Consultant determines plan's goal (equity or equity & bonds?) (must be at least 8% return)
- Consultant finds investments managers that plan's goals
- Consultant asks the investment managers for RFPs
- Investment managers prepare RFPs
- Investment managers present RFPs to consultant (insert presentation skills here)
- Consultant recommends the best fit inevstment manager to the plan
- Plan invests with the investment manager

### Benchmarks
are indices (singular: index)

An equity index is a basket of stocks rebalanced or adjusted usually in a yearly basis. 

There are 2 types of management styles:
- Active management
	- By using researched-based trading and competitive information, active mangers strive to beat the performance of a benchmark by generating higher returns.
- Passive management
	- Passive managers seek to have an average performance by matchin a given market index, rather than beating it. They believe the market will outperform individual funds in the long run. 

### Performance: luck or skill
The pension plans consultants will push you to see if what you did so far is by luck or skill. They will ask you if you are either a top or a bottom? Maybe you are a bottom-up valuator. Asset managers (you) can use `PORT` as evidence i guess, but first you're gonna need to know how to build your portfolio. 

## Summary
Defining a Portfolio Manager
- A portfolio manager invests on behalf of others
- Value, growth, and GARP are three types of stocks in which fund managers invest
- An active manager aims to beat the market. A passive manager aims to match it
- Investment consultants act as agents of clients to help them determine how to allocate their investments and to review their fund's performance
- Portfolio managers must regularly prove that their performance is due to skill rather than luck, and that they are investing in accordance with their clients wishes
