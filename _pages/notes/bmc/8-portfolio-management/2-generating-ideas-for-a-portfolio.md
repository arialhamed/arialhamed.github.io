# Generating Ideas for a Portfolio
Portfolio managers and their analysts will have to spend hundreds of ideas researching before building their portfolio. They would use `EQS` to screen. By the end of the module, you will be able to: 
- Screen for securities
- Simulate strategies by exploring their historical performance via backtesting
- Research companies for inclusion in a portfolio strategy

## You got a $400M mandate. All the best

There are strong value investors who would rather look at the P/B ratio, a price-to-book ratio:
- The company's price divided by company's book value per share
- Gosh
