# Commodities trading
quality, grade, location, transportation, refining. all these are involved in trading & prices in trading. This is a bilateral business. 

You can find benchmarks in `GLCO`. There is no singular global market price for crude oil, but there are regional benchmarks. 

### What effects price?
- Mother nature - Powerful & Unpredictable
	- Hurricanes can shutdown refineries and grounding ships
	- Earthquakes and floods can bring mines to stop
	- Droughts can stop crops
- Trade war - Disruptions in imports & exports
	- Trump & tariffs in 2018
- The Saudis
	- Oil duhhh. Saudi Aramco was attacked by drones one time, and barrels were limited. 
- Policy - Differences between countries. 

### Demand Shock
Demand is usually less elastic, so a large change in demand can sweeps. Coronavirus cut planes & factories, and their supplies of course. Storage for oil is suffering, which is why oil was at negative price at some point (remember that lmaooo). 

US Equities hated covid because of the uncertainty. oh no /s

Healthcare & consumer staples weren't so affected, which is very very good imho. 

### Other factors
When you are scared, you are fearful. 
- The 2008 Price Crash
- Speculation
- Betting on the Bottom
- The Role of ETFs

### Summary quiz
Note to ari: if you are tired, just stop so that you won't fail 2 entire summary quizzes in a row 

## Summary
Commodities Trading
- Producers, consumers and traders of physical oil can use the financial benchmarks to hedge the risks and exposures on OTC contracts. Price reporting agencies like Platts and Argus provide a price assessment for a wide range of oil types and contracts. 
- The main reason why commodity trading happens are:
	- Safe haven during economic uncertainty
	- Inflation hedging
	- Diversification of portfolio
	- Speculation
- Like any other financial market, market sentiment can impact price. This phenomenon has become more pronounced with the increasing financialization of the commodities markets, as more people trade benchmark crude oils. 

### Conclusion
remember, there are volatility in the commodities market. look at them cabbages. You must be better than other traders & a good understanding on the fundamentals, you are set to take on the commodity markets.
