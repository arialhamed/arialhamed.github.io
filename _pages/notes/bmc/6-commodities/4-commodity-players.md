# Commodity Players

### Players | Producers & Consumers
Commodity companies are usually either producers or consumers. 

### Commodity Exposure

Producers may see price decreases, so they can see the highest selling price. Vice versa, consumers want lowest prices.

### Trading houses
They make profit from arbritrages
- geographical 
- time 
- production

### Investment banks 
also provide service for commodity industry:
- Project financing 
- Underwriting debt and equity
- Inventory financing
- Credit
- Commodity-backed financial instruments

In the past, they used to straight up participate in the commodity industry. After 2008 financial crisis, they had no choice but to sell it.  
Some still still have assets though such as Macquarie and Sumitomo

### Speculators
As the commodity market became more liquid, more people want to participate and speculate. 
- Safe haven
	- Such as gold
- Inflation hedging
	- commodities are independant from currencies
- Diversitication
	- Commodities have little relation to equities & bonds. 
- Pure speculation
	- Clairvoyance

### Trading Techniques
There are 2 types of trading techniques:
- Technical Trading
	- Technical traders invest after analysing chart patterns. They often employ partially automated systems, such as computer software programs, to follow price trends, perform technical analysis, and execute trades. 
- Quantitative Trading
	- Quantitative trading employs mathematical computations to analyse historical data in order to identify market price patterns. Using this research, computer models are then created which aim to predict future trading opportunities and are used in real time markets with real capital. Quantitative trading techniques include high-frequencey trading and algorithmic trading. 
		- Algorithmic trading (also referred to as automated, algo, or black box trading) is a process for executing orders utilizing automated and pre-programmed trading instructions to account for variables suchas price, timing and volume.
		- High-frequency trading (also know as HFT) is characterized by high speeds and turnover rates using powerful computer programs to transact a large number of orders in fractions of a second. 

The trading life cycle scenario
- Marketers ; "I have identified these buyers. Can you recall these?"
- Analysts : "What is the economic impact of moving the cargo somewhere else?"
- Operations : "Can you schedule some pipeline nominations?"
- Jr. Traders : "Can we sort the paperwork to send the cargo somewhere else?"

### Summary
- Corporations include producers and consumers of commodities.
	- Producers of commodities have exposure to price decreases and hedge the risk by buying instruments to lock in the highest selling price possible.
	- Consumers have exposure to price increase and want to lock in the lowest price possible. 
- Trading houses act as intermediaries between producers and consumers, moving raw materials from their place of production to their place of consumption. - Banks provide financing, credit, and hedging capabilities to all commodity market players. Banks used to own assets across the value chain, however, after the 2008 financial crisis and the bank bailout, most were forced to sell the assets and end physical trading. 
- Speculators are individuals or firms that take directional views on the asset prices of commodities without being invloved in the value chain or providing any service. - Speculation can be carried out using different instruments, from mutual funds or ETF's for retail investors, to indices for large asset managers, and futures for comodity trading advisors or CTAs.
