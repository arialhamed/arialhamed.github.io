## Summary
- Fundamentals such as storage, transportation, and variations in quality provide insight into the supply and demand structure of each commodity market. 
- Demand for oil is forecasted to grow in the long term, mostly due to increasing demand in the developing countries. OPEC was founded in the 1960s to monitor the stability and prices of oil markets to secure an efficient and regular supply of petroleum to consumers. 
- There are different types of refineries and they vary in sophistication - more sophisticated refineries will have the capabilities to turn crude into a higher humber of refined products. Crude oil can also vary widely in physical characteristics, such as density and sulfur content.
