# Introduction to Commodities
Things, basically. Tangible things. Remember Endless Sky and the trading things? Yeah those. The video goes through certain links between commodities. A commodity is classified as a raw material used to make goods. 
Today, there are 3 tradeable commodity categories
- Energy
- Agricultural
- Metals

You can find Global Commodity Prices (`GLCO`) in the terminal. It shows each categories that are further broken into subcategories  
In this module you will go through the following:
- History of commodities trading
- How supply and demand drives prices
- Commodity market players
- How to use Bloomberg to access comprehensive market data & news

### History | Historical Trading Problems
Yo this happens ever since, like Mesopotamia & Ancient Japan.  
Back then there are many over-the-counter contracts (OTC): between 2 individuals over a set amount for a set date.  
However, there has been a lot of disagreements, so there should be a need of standardization, so futures contracts has been created. 

### History | Emergence of the First Exchange
Dojima Rice Exchange, Japan 1710  
London Metals Exchange, London 1877  
Fun fact, LME now still uses the circle, i love that.  
Futures markets were developed to standardize transactions to eliminate counterparty risks. 

### History | The Chicago Board of Trade. 
Chicago Board of Trade, USA 1848  
Trading is now electronic, which is great because i hate a room of shouting people.  
You can find commodities futures contract database in Contract Table Menu (`CTM`). 

This is a significantly smaller module, this is a good break compared to equities & terminal basics ðŸ˜µ it's the section quiz already.
