# Currency Valuation
and drivers

### Observing currency strength
Currency pairs doesn't tell us the general strength amongst the world. To evaluate the overall strength of a currency, we use what are known as **trade-weighted baskets**

This is automatically calculated by typing in TRADEWEIGHTED, select the Trade Weighted Index for a country, then selecting `GP`.  
The chart shows how strong or weak is and historically. The index should begin in 100. 

Theory states that in the long run, identical goods & services should cost the same no matter where they are sold around the world.  
In 1986, the Big Mac index was released. This will show whether or not a currency is undervalued or overvalued. This can be found in the World Currency Ranker (`WCRS MAC`). 

### Three main currency drivers
Surprise changes in 
- Interest rates
- Inflation
- Trade

### Surprise changes in interest rates
Say someone wants to invest in government bonds of a different country. Interest rates drastically drop in one country, strengthening one another. 

When a central bank unexpectedly decrease interest rates, the government yields go down. This deters investment from around the world, reducing demand for that country's currency. The currency, therefore, typically weakens. 

<span style="font-size:180%;">Higher demand = Higher costs, and vice versa. Lesser demand of a currency, the currency becomes weaker.</span>

### Surprise changes in inflation
Scarcity drives value, abundance diminishes value. 

For example, India. The higher the inflation (via CPI), the weaker the Indian Rupee. This is because as the world outsources jobs to India, which drove up wages, and ultimately, prices. 

### Surprise changes in trade
Remember the GDP formula? The (X-M) thing applies the same.

Here's an example of a surprising decline in net exports led to a collapse of a currency.  
75% of Russia's exports are oil & gas, so Russia's exports are heavily dependant on the price of oil.  
Type in `RUBUSD` then `GP`. When the chart goes down, rubul weakening. Add in price of oil using "C01 Comdty" with "Brent". You can see a correlation between the 2 graphs. 
- Demand of oil collapse
- Price of oil collapse
- Russia's exports collapse
- Russia's rubul demand collapse
- Russia's rubul value collapse

That's insane but makes a lot of sense. Fun fact, this happened to Russia twice. 

### Switzerland case study
Let's take a look at switzerland. In 2011, people in the EU decided to buy Swiss Francs so that it would be able to counter the Greek debt crisis
- Swiss franc becomes overvalued
- Swiss exporters realized products will appear more expensive across the EU
- Swiss importers saw that foreign products (besides Switzerland) to be cheaper to buy because of the Swiss Franc
- May cause deflation. 
- (Surprise) Swiss Bank decides to print more swiss francs so that the value of it from the euros become lesser (from 0.96 to 0.8 euros). 

That's still insane. 

Sounds too good to be true? It was too good. 
- Swiss Bank stopped printing 
- They would have to buy more euros
- If the euro becomes weaker than the francs, 


<span style="font-size:170%;">If a country's currency becomes too expensive, there won't be enough exports, which means lesser GDP.</style>

## Summary
Currency Valuation Drivers
- The value of a currency is relative and not absolute
- Trade-weighted baskets express currency overal strength and weakness.
- In the long run, the "law of one price" drives currency values.
- In the short run, these are three o the main drivers of currency valuation:
	- Surprise changes in interest rates
	- Surprise changes in inflation
	- Surprise changes in trade
