# Central Banks and Currencies

Interest rate & inflation are prominent drivers of currency valuation as state previously. Let's talk more about howboutdat?

### The Inflation Vicious Cycle
Type in Inflation Monitor (`IFMO`).  
Central banks globally have a job in guarding against inflation & deflation. Low but positive inflation is typically a plus for economies
- Protects consumer purchasing power
- Keeps borrowing costs low
- Provides stable backdrop for businesses to make investments & hiring decisions.

Inflation targetting is hard because it is **psychological**. IT IS A VICIOUS CYCLE. 
- Workers expect prices to increase
- Workers demand pay increases
- Comapny wages go up
- Companies raise their prices

and then it loops.

### Inflation response case study
Type in Interest rates, go to `FTDR` index (for US), then `GP`. Overlay CPI in the same chart. 

High interest rates sucked out money so that inflation will decrease.  
Saving money become more attractive compared to spending it on goods & services. 

### The deflation vicious cycle
A Central bank would usually have to keep down inflation but not entirely. However, deflation could happen, though very rarely.  
Deflation is also a cycle.
- Product prices decline
- Consumer defer purchases to await lower prices
- Company revenues decline
- Companies let go of worker to cut costs
- Less salary people
- Less demand of products

and then it loops. 

### Deflation response case study
As with inflation, unorthodox methods may work against deflation.  
As with Switzerland, Shinzo Abe of Japan started Abenomics. 
- Gov printed more moeny to buy government bonds
- Increase of bank's interest rate from 1% to 2% (i think)

the yen fell, but inflation rate rose to an acceptable amount, <strong style="font-size: 250%;">2% inflation rate</strong>

## Summary
Central Banks and Currencies
- Central bankers control the levels of the currency markets.
- The standard inflation target is 2% for industrialized nations. 
- Inflation can lead to a vicious cycle of pay increases leading to price increases. 
- Deflation can lead to a vicious cycle of purchase deferrals and layoffs.
