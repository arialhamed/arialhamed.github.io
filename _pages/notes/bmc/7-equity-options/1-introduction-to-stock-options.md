# Introduction to Stock Options

Options trading??? It is a contractual agreement between 2 parties which gives the holder the right - but not the obligation - to buy & sell stock. This seems good.  
Options:
- What options are and who trades them
- The history of options trading
- Language used by options market players
- The role of stock options traders 
- Options trading strategies

An option contract is basically, a contract for options. For stock options, there are 8 contractual components (terms of trade):
1. Who buys and who sells
1. How many listed contracts are traded
1. What is the underlying asset that the listed option is based upon
1. What type of listed option is traded
1. The price of the listed option contract
1. The price of the underlying asset that the listed contract can be exercised at
1. The listed contract expiration date
1. What style of listed option is traded

What really is a stock option contract? Basically once a buyer gets it you can buy it.  
There are 2 types of options in a contract:
- Call option - a contract giving someone the right to buy stock
- Put option - a contract giving someone the right to sell stock

An option's `DES` page shows all these i guess. The Strike price is also known as the exercise price. 

### History 
Options has been around for thousands of years. Aristotle's Olive Oil & the Netherlands' Tulips. Over the counter stock options were available ever since the stock house was built. Edward Callahan contributed to technology that made the contracts & exchanges much more efficient. I guess back then it was known as bucket shops. Bucket shops is not a positive term lmaooo. Jesse Livermore made that better though. 

Fischer Black & Myron Scholes published The Pricing of Options & Corporate Liabilities, and had a formula in it. They got a nobel price for economics. 

From 1983, online trading became available through many platforms, one of which included the one and only Bloomberg!!

### Trading Stock Options
The exchanges were/are done through derivatives. The outcry pit is done & out, there became electronic trading. Not only was it faster, it was also quite cheaper. 

Bespoke Contracts: Not all stock options are traded in an exchange, as they can be done through online. 

### Who Trades Options?
Derivatives exist to transfer risk from one party to another. People who trade options can be categorized into 3:
- Hedgers
	- They trim so that their positions are cared for, and not overgrown. 
- Speculators
	- Fortune tellers. All or nothing, based on their feelings
- Arbitrageurs
	- Riskless profit, multiple positions to get a small but fast profit.

Traders can be either of these or at the same time, but there are also more players in the stock options market:
- Market makers
	- The biggest contributers, they are essential in making liquidity. the people between buyers and sellers. Liquidity providers. 
- Proprietary traders
	- Speculators who trade using their own capital, and are often associated with hedge-funds
- Portfolio managers
	- Trader(s) that manages someone else's money, sometimes known as institutional investors. 
- High frequency traderes
	- Electronic traders (arbitrageurs), basically tech gurus who use systems to the work for them (probably me hahahah)
- Structured equity traders
	- Employed by investment/sell-side banks, sells exotic components. 
- Retail traders
	- You and me, our own money. We can do speculative & hedging style. Lesser risk. 

### Why Trade Stock Options?
WHY THOOO??????  
Options are financial derivatives from the underlying markets (take a peek at the Options Monitor (`OMON`)).  
As an equity derivative, there are 4 major benefits to stock options instead of stock:
- cost efficiency
	- Options don't really cost anything, unless stock is transferred over. 
- increased profitability
	- economics girl math 
		- stock ownerships is dollar return divby investment cost
		- call options is dollar return divby option cost
	- Even though the dollar return is smaller in options than ownership, the actual percentage return is higher because you spend much less. 
- minimize loss or insurance
	- put options can be used as "portfolio insurance". Just like the above, you lose less than buying stock
- strategic flexibility
	- don't need to be traded individually. 
	- can be used to make profit even if the market doesn't move. 
	- options traders can look at the market in 3 dimensions.

## Summary
- Options contracts are agreements that give two parties the right to buy or sell the underlying asset. 
- There are two types of options:
	- Call options - The right to buy the underlying asset at the strike price
	- Put option - The right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price
- Options traders can be broadly categorized into the three types of participants:
	- Hedgers - Traders focused on strategies that lower risk
	- Speculators - Traders focused on making a profit by capitalizaing on a specific market prediction
	- Arbitrageurs - Traders focused on earning a riskless profit by taking multiple positions
