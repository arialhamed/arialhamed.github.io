# Basic Multi-leg Strategies
Oh gosh now this is the same shit as the previous but multi-threaded ðŸ˜­  
There are 3 common two-leg strategies:
- A straddle
- A strangle
- A collar

These can lock in profits.  
Equity option traders are into some kinky sh*t. 

### Rumors of a New Product
A lot of stock images & clips. 

### The Straddle
Imagine riding 2 horses at the same time, your left leg is PUT, your right leg is CALL

### The Strangle
uwu dies because no oxygen X3

losing money because of time decay (theta)

Omg, all of these are just looking at the graph, ffs

### The Collar
After some aggressive trading, now it's time to get some safety helmets and buying some insurance. A collar is basically min-max

## Summary
- Multi-leg strategies, trading more than one option at a time, improves the risk profile and increases profit or return.
- Three common multi-leg strategies are the straddle, the strangle, and the collar.
- Choosing the best options trading strategy is more of an art than a science and requires practice and hands on experience. Choosing the best strategy depends on your view, objective, and risk profile.
