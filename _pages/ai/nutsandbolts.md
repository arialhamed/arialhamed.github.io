# Nuts & Bolts (Object Detection) 

## page WIP

In Y3S2, as an assignment for an A.I. module, _Advanced Topics in A.I._, me and an a friend teamed up to create our own models to identify **nuts & bolts** in an image or video. <br>The existing materials that were given (or rather, in a completely honest sense, _spoonfed_) to us were of great use in training the model and in creating the output (shown here later). <br>The bulk of the work lays on annotating the images for training. I used [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/), a free & open-source annotating tool for images that would be (usually) be utilized in machine learning. They export in almost every possible format, so I was able to export my +300 annotations and images to my project, which requires Pascal VOC

This page is still WIP, but for now i simply have this video my mobilenetv2 model finding out what is a bolt in a video ðŸ˜Š
