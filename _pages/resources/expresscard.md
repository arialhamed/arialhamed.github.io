# ExpressCard

> _"ExpressCard? is that, like, a credit card with express credit?"_ - a millenial

Even though I am a millenial myself (as of <span class="timestamp">Q3 2022</span>), I have became very mentally invested and intrigued about ExpressCard this year. To be honest, i don't know what this page is going to be, but it's here.

There's more information on <a href="https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ExpressCard_slot" target="_blank">which ThinkPads have ExpressCard</a>. How I learned about ExpressCard was when I searched up the details about my [X230](https://arialhamed.github.io/guides/upgrades/thinkpad/X230), and it had the second one up there, the L looking one.

Here's a list of the possible ExpressCard expansion devices:
- More USB ports (best known is <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000281807808.html" target="_blank">2x USB 3.0</a>) 
	- Someone with an **X230** like me who already has 2 readily available USB 3.0 ports, this may be very redundant, especially with my scenario where i don't even use the 2 USB ports daily, but it could be very useful for someone with a laptop that doesn't have a USB 3.0 port, like the **X220**
- <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1024172-REG/hp_aj451aa_hp_express_card_smart.html" target="_blank">Smart card reader</a> (<b>useful</b>)
	- I feel that this is useful when I end up in a workplace that uses cards for security, such as government services or the military. It could also jumpstart me into card technology, though more or less smart card technology is slowly getting retconned by the Singapore government (such as the kopitiam card getting relocated to the fairprice app)
- Fingerprint reader (<b>useful</b>)
	- Now, if only, if only this can exist with the touch version, not the swipe version. I really love the touch fingerprint reader from my Yoga C640, which was a huge step from when I was using the X250 and its fingerprint reader, which is very similar to the X230's fingerprint reader (extracted from an X220). The only caveat with the touch fingerprint reader on the C640 is that it was not compatible with Linux, only Windows. To be frank, I wouldn't end up using a fingerprint reader expresscard as most often or not, or rather, all the times, including my current X230, all has built-in fingerprint reader (even that other one that my dad picked off the trash somehow).
- <a href="https://thinkmods.store/products/expresscard-to-nvme-adapter" target="_blank">NVMe adapter</a>
	- Now this one is interesting, because the max speed of an Expresscard slot (for the X230 at least) is **_5 Gbps_**, which is slower than SATA 3. Using an NVMe SSD in the Expresscard slot does give a lot of potential for many use cases, especially on another laptop like the T430 (and its numerous counterparts), where it can have the WWAN as mSATA, the Ultrabay for HDD, and the default HDD slot, topped off with this adapter, a T430 can have **_4_** different modes of storage. Maybe one can be a totally different boot...
- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creative-SB0950-ExpressCard-Blaster-Notebook/dp/B001BS3A3E" target="_blank">Sound Blaster</a>, basically a DAC (<b>useful</b>)
	- I'm not sure, because I am more than satisfied with the audio quality from the X230's audio jack, but maybe my situation does not apply to other laptops with ExpressCard.
- <a href="http://www.bplus.com.tw/cardreader/EC230.html" target="_blank">SD Card reader (SD/SDHC/SDIO)</a> 
	- More often or not, a machine that comes with an ExpressCard slot would usually come with an SD card reader already, though it could be tremendously helpful if you're someone who works on SD Cards, like a photographer.
- <a href="https://www.newegg.com/global/sg-en/bytecc-bt-ec1s-1-x-serial-ports-expresscard/p/N82E16839229005" target="_blank">RJ-45 Ethernet port</a>
	- Same as SD Card reader where this could be redundant, but there is still some use. Depending on your device and the Ethernet ExpressCard speeds, using an Ethernet port ExpressCard could provide faster speeds compared to the laptop's default Ethernet port, because there is a higher bandwidth of data through an ExpressCard slot, as it was in that era.
- ExpressCard Modem
	- Tremendously useful, as on occasion I find myself in a location without WiFi, and I then depend on my hotspot, which is a time-consuming process, making it inconvenient to use. 
	- As I said that now, I realize that I can enable design thinking into it! Perhaps I could create my own, definitely in the distant future.
 	- This exists already btw, but really hard to find.
- <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/pla/RS232-DB9-Serial-IO-Port-to_62440344480.html?mark=google_shopping&biz=pla&searchText=computer+accessories&product_id=62440344480&language=en" target="_blank">RS-232 Serial port</a>
	- Literally the only reason for me to get this card is if I worked on real industrial equipment, in which I have never worked on any, or at least those with those serial ports, or if I work on those medical equipment or older devices, as I always see whenever I drop by IMH.
- literally <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/253783318363" target="_blank">ExpressCard to PCMCIA Adapter, 34mm to 54mm</a>, basically expresscard to expresscard, kinda like USB-A 3.0 to USB-C 3.0
	- Link's dead btw. Not that useful since PCMCIA is older compared to ExpressCard.
- <a href="https://www.memoryc.com/14972-64gb-wintec-filemate-solidgo-expresscard-34-ssd.html" target="_blank">SSD</a> (known max size is 64GB)
	- tfw the SD card, a technology technically older than ExpressCard, outlasts ExpressCard as a solid-state storage device. Not useful, especially compared to the NVMe adapter (no SSD included in that though).
- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-ExpressCard-Capture-Adapter-ECHDCAP/dp/B008YT5QEO" target="_blank">HDMI Output</a>, though i'm not too sure about it, still (<b>useful</b>)
	- I just wish I could just slap that on there, but I don't think the one I linked here is related to actual HDMI output, could be related to the eGPU later on in this list. I could also wish for a full-size DisplayPort (as X230 uses MiniDisplayPort, but the X220 uses a full-size DisplayPort! If only, if only...)
- ExpressCard Mouse (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Mogo-Bluetooth-X54-Presenter/dp/B004AMRT62/" target="_blank">amazon</a> & <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-01-07-mogo-mouse-x54-made-for-expresscard-slots.html" target="_blank">blog about it</a>), yes it exists, though seeing that the blog was last updated in 2007, i don't think its available anymore. (<b>useful</b> but redundant for a ThinkPad user like me))
- eGPU (google it)
	- a brief cost overview about an ExpressCard eGPU on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/68ntpw/comment/dh00vxv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, though it is 5 years old..
- many different 3D-printed storage options
	- <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1323651" target="_blank">USB dongle, SD Card & Micro SD Card holder</a>
	-

now, there are many options, but honestly, it's not enough. I want the following to exist:

- **WiFi 5** or **WiFi _6_** ExpressCard
	- With 5Gbps, probably possible, but I haven't the foggiest idea if it works, I don't have that sic electrical engineering knowledge.
- **_USB-C_** (**USB 3.0**) ExpressCard
	- _this just has to exist_, like somewhere in the depths of the factories of China, there has to be someone who's has it right now!!!
