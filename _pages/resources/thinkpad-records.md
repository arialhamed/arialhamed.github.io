# The greatest of the greatest of the ThinkPads

This page is dedicated to the furthest of the ThinkPads. I'm not gonna lie, it's better to explain it by showing it:
- Last PowerPC ThinkPad: **ThinkPad G5** (2006)
    - This ThinkPad has the PowerPC G5 processor, and was the last PowerPC ThinkPad. However, it was discontinued in 2007, which was when IBM was struggling with ThinkPad (and also G5 was a commercial flop) and handed it over to Lenovo in the same year.

    - This ThinkPad weighed over 10 pounds. It was given great praise for the digitizer & dual-screen. However, due to its niche, there was no direct success, and it was discontinued the following year.
- Smallest ThinkPad: **ThinkPad 701C** (1995)
    - Also known as the "Butterfly" due to its unique folding keyboard design, it remains a popular collector's item among ThinkPad enthusiasts due to its innovative design and historical significance.
- Lightest ThinkPad: **ThinkPad X1 Nano** (2020)
    - The X1 Nano weighs only 907g, an also only 14.8mm thin. Fun fact: it has Thunderbolt!
- ThinkPad with a built-in printer: **ThinkPad 550BJ** (1999)
    - A ThinkPad with a built-in printer, the 550BJ was not like other ThinkPads. The printer used special thermal paper that was loaded into the printer via a tray located on the front of the laptop. It could print up to 720 x 360 dots per inch (dpi) resolution and up to 3 pages per minute.
- ThinkPad that is also a light-projector component:
