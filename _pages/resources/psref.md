Education is the most powerful weapon or whatever. This is page is just a by-product of my obsession with data hoarding.

page is wip

Here is a quick guide about ThinkPad naming convention I found on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/vd2neh/comment/ichtatk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">Reddit</a>:

> Pre-2020 naming scheme (T480s):<br>T - Series designation.<br>4 - Screen size. In this case, 14 inches.<br>8 - Model year. In this case, 2018.<br>0 - CPU brand. 0 for Intel, 5 for AMD, 1 is used on some rare, oddball 2013 Thinkpads and the X201 (1st Gen Intel Core)<br>s - sub-series designation. S for “Slim”, P for “Performance”<br><br>Post-2020 naming scheme (E15 Gen 4):<br>E - Series designation.<br>15 - Screen Size. In this case, 15 inches.<br>Gen 4 - 4th generation of this nameplate? Useless for information, you basically have to Google it<br>

..and here is a series designation for pre-2020 (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/ssjjzr/comment/hwyp5zb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">source</a> & <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#E_Series_(2011%E2%80%93current)">wikipedia</a>), i've rephrased:

- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_T_series">**_T_** series (**2000**-**current**)</a> are the middle-ground, the **high-end <span style="text-decoration:underline;">flagship</span>** ThinkPad, the _"T"_ in ThinkPad, and the longest living ThinkPad series, ever since IBM still had ThinkPad. The first ones you may see or think about a ThinkPad.
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_X_series">**_X_** series (**2000**-**current**)</a> are the main high-end **high-end <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ultraportable</span>** ThinkPad line, offering a lightweight, highly portable laptop with moderate performance.
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_E_series">**_E_** series (**2011**-**current**)</a> is a **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">low-cost</span>** ThinkPad line, designed for **_small business_ mass-market** requirements, laptops that **replaced the Edge series**.
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_L_series">**_L_** series (**2010**-**current**)</a> are the **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">mid-range</span>** ThinkPad that **replaced the R series**.
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_P_series">**_P_** series (**2015**-**current**)</a> (successor to the W series) are designed as **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">portable workstations</span>, designed for engineers, architects, animators, etc**. All P series ThinkPads have fingerprint scanners.
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#Z_series_(2022)">**_Z_** series (**2022**)</a>  is marketed towards **business customers**, as well as a **generally <span style="text-decoration:underline;">younger audience</span>**. eh. Not really well known or good, even though there's just 2 models for now.
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#i_Series_(1998%E2%80%932002)">**_i_** series (**1998**-**2002**)</a> were historic ThinkPads that were geared towards <span style="text-decoration:underline;">**multimedia**</span> users.
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#A_Series_(2000%E2%80%932004)">**_A_** series (**2000**-**2004**)</a> were the **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">desktop replacement</span>** ThinkPad back then.
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#R_Series_(2001%E2%80%932010,_2018-2019)">**_R_** series (**2001**–**2010**, **2018**-**2019**)</a> were **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">budget</span> line** ThinkPads. Not much details in Wikipedia for me to write down here.
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#G_Series_(2003%E2%80%932006)">**_G_** series (**2003**-**2006**)</a> were <span style="text-decoration:underline;">**desktop replacements with desktop processors**</span> (for its time). There were only 3 in this series.
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#Z_Series_(2005%E2%80%932007)">**_Z_** series (**2005**-**2007**)</a>, not to be mistaken with the 2022 series, were released as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">**high-end multimedia**</span> laptops. Reading from the Wiki, there's not much remarkable about this series besides the **optional titanium lid**.
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#SL_Series_(2008%E2%80%932010)">**_SL_** series (**2008**-**2010**)</a> was launched as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">**low-end**</span> ThinkPad for <span style="text-decoration:underline;">**small businesses**</span>. Fun fact: this series uses <span style="text-decoration:underline;">**IdeaPad-based firmware**</span>.
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_W_Series">**_W_** series (**2008**-**2015**)</a> were introduced as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">**w**orkstation-class</span> laptops, deriving from the T series suffixed with "p". This series were geared towards CAD users, photographers, power users, and others, who need a high-performance system for demanding tasks. 
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_E_series">**_Edge_** series (**2010**)</a> were released as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">**small business**</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">**consumer-end machines**</span>. The design was a radical departure compared to the traditional black boxy ThinkPad design, with glossy surfaces (optional matte finish on later models), rounded corners, and silver trim. A dumbass design in my opinion, and it really shows as it only lived one year.
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#S_Series_(2012%E2%80%932014)">**_S_** series (**2012**-**2014**)</a> were <span style="text-decoration:underline;">mid-range ThinkPads</span>, and came in a lot of metals and colors. 
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#A_Series_(2017%E2%80%932018)">**_A_** series (**2017**-**2018**)</a> were basically ThinkPads featuring AMD's PRO chipset technology.
