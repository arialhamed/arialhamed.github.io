This is more, like, for me to reference to. i learned some things **and i will forget them** after a while, so here it is.

A lot of what is existing here is an extension of this file

## Nautilus
### Change location of default bookmarks

While it's always easy to add a bookmark in any file manager, it becomes a different story when it comes to changing the location afterwards.
- In Windows, it's straight-forward and easy, well, for the existing default bookmarks anyway.
	- Right click
	- Go to 'location'
	- 'Move' + 'Apply'
	- Done
- In Linux with Gnome
	- What location?

Then it gets more complicated when it comes to splitting into **display server protocols**. There is [a whole list of protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_display_servers) and if you're running Linux, you are definitely using one of these. 

#### For all intends and purposes, what I have here is for Gnome Wayland.

``` bash

```
