# Optimized Screen Recording <span style="font-size:70%">on Android</span>

_&lt;note for ari: state how android 11 or so already gives screen recording but it kinda sucks because it uses the same gpu or whatever&gt;_

A lot of commands here actually relates to the [Android Debug Bridge](https://arialhamed.github.io/guides/adb), and a few pieces of software that I will explicitly state that is needed.

### Here are some programs that you need to start recording your Android phone's audio and screen:
* <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools">Android SDK Platform Tools</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases/tag/v1.23">scrcpy</a> by <a href="http://genymobile.com/">Genymotion</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/rom1v/sndcpy/releases/tag/v1.1">sndcpy</a> by <a href="https://github.com/rom1v">rom1v</a>
* Your Android phone
* A USB cable to connect your phone to your computer (should be USB-C or Micro USB)
* OBS Studio (it's free)

_&lt;more details will come soon&gt;_
