## Overpowered Android Gaming (June 2023)

Note: This does not include Google Play Store, but rather this guide is meant for WSA Sideloading

I call this overpowered because using a laptop or PC device, which has a laptop or PC CPU, is much more overpowered compared to phone CPU.

1. Download Revision OS, Windows 11 Version, <a href="revi.cc" target="_blank">here</a>, install OS to PC.
1. Install Firefox (optional but recommended)
1. Go to <a href="https://store.rg-adguard.net/" target="_blank">rg-adguard</a>
1. Select the **Productid** option, paste this ID: **9p3395vx91nr**, select the **Slow** option, and click the Check button.
1. Download the probably largest file, around 1.3GB. Make sure it is saved as either **.appx** or **.msixbundle** file
1. Open PowerShell as **Administrator**, go to the directory where that file is
1. Type in `Add-AppxPackage Microsoft*.msixbundle`
1. WSA should be installed. 
1. Download <a href="https://github.com/alesimula/wsa_pacman" target="_blank">WSA Pacman</a>. At first .apk or .xapk installation, you may need to click on some other stuff to allow installation.
