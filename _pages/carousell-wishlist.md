## carousell wishlist

<!-- - mSATA -->
- <a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/lenovo-thinkpad-1146403347/">ThinkPad X130e</a>
    - Price: **SGD$50**
    - omg LOOK HOW CUTE, TINY & RUGGED IT IS!!!
    - That has to be the best laptop deal of all of carouse- I should've waited a bit more, I could've saved $100! 
    - Of course, not dissing on the X230, the X130e actually has below average specs especially compared to the X230, but damn does it still has good value for what it is!
    - Oh and the location is AMK too, which is where I know a thing or 2 about that place.
    - I have 2 problems now though: 
        - The Dog & Bone Problem:
            - As of 2022-Nov-13, there are 16 likes to it
            - That means 16 people including me have their eyes on it
            - Me as a collector, this poses as a threat
        - The Morality Problem
            - Those people who have their eyes on it are also likely to be parents who want to give their child a laptop for their schoolwork
            - The fact that it is listed at $50, no doubt those parents could be lower income as well
            - Even though I am lower income as well (both family & the fact that I am still a student), I already have a killer laptop
- IBM ThinkPad R50e
    - There are 2 listings i found:
        - <a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/promotion-until-30-nov-lenovo-laptop-ibm-thinkpad-r50e-1034736926/"><b>SGD$150</b> <s><b>SGD$205</b></s></a>
            - Found in AMK, pretty good location as well
        - <a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/ibm-thinkpad-r50e-68646339/"><b>SGD$30</b></a>
            - This one has `No battery and charger but still working` ? I also have second thoughts
    - Just like the X130e above, this is also hella' gorgeous, though it is also hella' outdated
- <a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/ibm-thinkpad-docking-station-t40-r50-x30-t30-r30-a30-with-2-x-power-supply-adapter-1194036984/">IBM ThinkPad Docking Station</a>
    - Price: **SGD$15**
    - To be frank, I have not done a lot of research on the ThinkPad docks that belonged to IBM, but I believe this one is compatible with a few IBM ThinkPads that I have listed here
    - This comes with 2 power adapters apparently
- <a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/ibm-thinkpad-x60-laptop-1177090363/">IBM ThinkPad X60</a>
- <a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/upgraded-thinkpad-t530-1180375630">ThinkPad T530</a>
    - Price: **SGD$250**
    - Nothing super special about this ThinkPad, it just has a quad-core, idm replacing my X230 with this

- <a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/for-parts-2x-lenovo-x220-x230-ips-lcd-screen-panels-1192731179/">X220/X230 IPS LCD screen panels</a>
    - Price: **SGD$10**
    - Damn that's a good price, though i am still contemplating if i really want to sacrifice the battery life over visuals
- <a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/thinkpad-laptop-stand-deck-1108021284/">ThinkPad Adjustable Stand</a>

### Honorable mentions (don't actually buy these for me)

- <a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/boxy-pixel-unhinged-gameboy-advance-sp-1191385638/">GBA Unhinged</a>
    - Price: **SGD$500**
    - This dude straight up did a one of a kind mod to their Gameboy Advance SP, where there is no hinge at all
    - It's a solid GBA, it even has the triggers.
