hii welcome to my #linkinbio and kinda my portfolio

This is my website where i do some things sometimes, where i get to express myself, talk about some interesting things like technology & it's interaction with humans, and it's also my personal tool ðŸ› 

I'll let this melody, harmony & rhythm of HTML, CSS & JS (respectively) do all the talking! :3
