- Consider the formula: GDP = C + I + G + (X - M). A country..
	- GDP rose by 10 billion
		- A 5 billion increase in government spending will increase GPD by 5 billion, the 5 billion increase in personal consumption will increase GDP by 5 billion, thereby causing overall GDP to increase by their sum of 10 billion
	- GDP declines..
	- GDP rose by ..

	- Nominal GDP..
	- Nominal GDP 5% and inflation rate of 2%
		- Real GDP Growth = Nominal GDP Growth - Inflation. The real GDP growth rate = 5% - 2% = 3% is the highest of the choices.

### Section Quiz
- Take a look at the GDP components for the United States in the World Economic Statistics screen (ECST&lt;GO&gt;) below. Which GDP component was the biggest contributor at the time that this screen was captured?
	- Consumer spending
		- Personal consumption expenditures (consumer spending) was the highest contributor to the U.S. GDP.
	- Government spending
	- Exports
- Which of the following lines is the best leading economic indicator?
	- Real GDP growth
	- PMI
		- The objective of a leading indicator is to signal the emergence of impending turning points in real GDP growth. During the sever recession that commenced in late 2008, the PMI declined to its lowest point and began its recovery well before the GDP reached its trough and subsequently rebounded. 
	- Nonfarm payrolls
- GPD per capita is a measure of prosperity because it divides the total GDP of a country by its population. Which of the below forecasts for a country would result in the largest decline in per capita GDP?
	- An increase of 4% in GDP and a population growth of 5%
	- An increase of 2% in GDP and a population growth of 0%
	- An increase of 3% in GDP and a population growth of 6%
		- Accounting for population growth is a major factor in determing how prosperous a country can become. An increase in gross GDP is not the only factor that determines the prosperity growth of a country. All else equal, higher population growth will decrease the per capita GDP. 
- What typically happens to nonfarm payrolls, the PMI indicator, and housing starts at the onset of a recession in the United States?
	- Nonfarm payrolls go DOWN, the PMI indicator goes UP, the housing starts goes UP
	- Nonfarm payrolls go UP, the PMI indicator goes DOWN, the housing starts goes DOWN
	- Nonfarm payrolls go DOWN, the PMI indicator goes DOWN, the housing starts goes DOWN
		- At the onset of a recession, people lose their jons, businesses lose confidence, and fewer people can afford to buy houses. Accordingly, nonfarm payrolls, which measures the change in the number of people with jobs, goes down. The PMI indicator, which denotes confidence with a high reading and anxiety with a low reading, goes down. The housing starts, which represents the number of new houses being built, also goes down. 

### Summary
The Primacy of GDP
- Real GDP growth is the main gauge of economic health
- Economic growth is cyclical, with a series of booms and busts 
- Investors interpret the economy through economic indicators
- Leading indicators attract the most investor interest
