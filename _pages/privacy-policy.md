# Privacy Policy
Last updated: April 8, 2025

I do not collect any personal information, like at all.

..except in [/resources/browse-my-repos](/resources/browse-my-repos) where it is **optional** to allow my GitHub App to read your repositories, _including private ones_, but any content & information from your repositories are not saved anywhere.

That's about it.
