so this is where i got some dumbass ideas lol

### song name ideas
- fires around me / lost in fire
	- the music video is some person waking up in the middle of a barn fire and wandering what to do. when the bridge kicks in the person submits to their fate and sit in the middle doing nothing. when the halftime enters after the bridge, the person wakes up unscathed in the middle of the ruins that was once the barn (the barn can be anything else, really)
- surround sound
	- a song about my auditory problems that came with autism. the music video will be like me going through a tunnel of blinding and variable lights (like the inside of a glowworm or smth idk)
- higher beings / why can't i hear you
	- this should be a song about my struggle in understanding god and his children. the music video would just be me sitting on the grass drawing out random stuff that kinda syncs with the song, mostly each drawing is how each person understands and hears from god. maybe like when putting down each note/drawing there would be a short flashback of how they receive. the ending should be like the wind blows away all of the notes away, resolute that everyone hears him differently
- leave my lies
	- a _coming out as trans_ song. consider doing this with another trans musician, preferably ftm.
- darksong
	- about depression
- authentic
	- about unmasking. the music video should be related to masks, or maybe like security, or maybe like that mobile game called vector
- volcano
	- about bottling up (prolly similar to figure09). music video obviously related to volcano
- clockwork city
	- song about clockwork city. make the video & song steampunk related, kinda like the ballad of mona lisa
- ice coffee night
	- song about regrets & grief keeping me up at night
