# Needlework

As of <timestamp>2022 March</timestamp>, I got knee-deep into needlework! It all started when I was in a quick design competition to create a bag out of cardboard (using design thinking as well of course) and I realized that all the forms of fasteners were absolutely the worst. 
- Glue can't hold 2 huge pieces of cardboard together (and we weren't trusted with super-glue), 
- sticky tac is essentially the same, 
- staplers were too harsh for thick cardboard (if it could even penetrate at the first place), 
- and masking tape always fall off!

Then, I decide to look through what we had. I saw the rough twine, then it hit me. I decided to poke holes through the cardboard and I was able to "sew" it together! The facilitator commented that I was basically doing leatherwork on cardboard. After that, I was still hungering for that very satisfying sewing result, where 2 membranes are stuck together, no adhesive, but only with string. 

I decided to archive my needlework project descriptions, here in this page. So far, I feel that this new hobby of mine is an successor to origami. I pride myself in fine motor skills and sharp hand-eye coordination. 

### Creations
- Headphones Sleeve
    - I had an old jacket that I didn't want to waste by throwing it away, so I cut out one sleeve, sewn and sealed together the side where it was seperated from the body of the jacket, and that's the basic shape. I just slide in my headphones and now my headphones are safe from both the outside and my own sweat!. 
    - Currently, the sleeve exit allows for my headphones to charge, though it does appear to easily let the headphones slip out.
    - To remedy that, I just added two snap buttons on the exit. Quite robust, and using two means the cable can just enter and rest between the two snap buttons when the snap buttons are together.
    - In my next iteration, I intend to make the part where it touches the top of the head to be stiff, but I don't think it's absolutely necessary.

### Modifications
- Laptop Sleeve with Stand
    - It currently comes with the default "Laptop Sleeve" leather badge on the lid, which is actually really annoying (if I use a mouse), and the velcro tends to get dirty as well. 
    - All I did was remove the velcro slips on both sides and sewn in three snap buttons. 
    - Another upgrade I have some intentions on is to add a phone stand to the lid, but I will need to test the existing modification first properly.
- Bobby Security Backpack
    - This backpack will receive multiple mods that I will list here.
    - The first mod that I did was to sew in a hook to the inside, so that I can hang a screwdriver set inside, to the wall of the backpack.
    - Next, I decided to sewing in my initials to the backpack, because this specific backpack is quite popular. As of <span class="timestampt">Apr 2022</span>, I have a close friend who just happened to have the same backpack, so yeah time to make it super customized, like Kubuntu.

### Repairs & Maintenance
- Envelope phone cover
    - Essentially, the envelope part was falling off already, and super-glue only made it last for about a week. I decided to incorporate double-threaded sewing & backstitching, and now all the essential contact points (and more) of the envelope part & the actual phone case is absurdly secured. 
    - I can see that sewing can also repair cracks in the case as well.
- Bobby Security Backpack
    - Somehow, the fabric next to one of the side-pocket zips got torn, and because of the loose ends, zipping and storing items in the side-pocket zip became such a pain. This happened a while ago, and back then I only had adhesive, which does not do well with fabric
    - Now, all I needed to do was simply just sew it back. Easy.
