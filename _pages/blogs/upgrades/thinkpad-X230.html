<h1>The ThinkPad X230, the legend & fan favourite <span style="font-size:60%;">^_^</span></h1>

As of <timestamp>27 September 2022</timestamp>, I have had received a (kinda) new ThinkPad X230 ([more details about it below](#doc)), so i've decided to jack it up!

<!-- <timestamp>[2022-Sept-27]</timestamp> hello lovelies 😊 yesterday after church, i was able to get my hands on an <b>X230</b> through Carousell! 💗 and believe me, when i entered the seller's home <span style="font-size:65%">(yes they let me in lol, they're a great person btw)</span> and laid my eyes on it, i immediately fell in love. after bringing it home and doing some minor changes, i have concluded that it will be my daily driver from now on <span style="font-size: 65%;">(as i attempt to sell my Yoga C640 lol)</span> -->

                <h2>Chapter 1: X250</h2><br><br>

                before i even have this X230, i owned an <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/sg/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-x-series/ThinkPad-X250/p/22TP2TX2500">X250</a> (<a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/lenovo-thinkpad-x250">review</a> & <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arialhamed/static/main/pdf/resources/psref/laptops/thinkpad/ThinkPad_X250.pdf">specs</a>). That costed me back then <span style="font-size:65%;">SGD</span>$350, back around 2018. Looking back now, for a laptop with a 5th gen processor and 500GB HDD, i kinda feel _scammed_. To be fair, back then i wasn't so tech-savvy about anything back then.<br><br>
                
                However, even for it's dubious $$$, I used it around May of this year, and for some reason, i just began to use it much more than my C640, even though the C640 was sporting a: <br>
                - i7-10510U<br>
                - 16GB DDR4 dual-channel (soldered)<br>
                - 1920-1080 IPS touchscreen <br>
                - obviously a 2 in 1<br>
                obviously much more powerful, and if anything, better than the X250 in almost any aspect, which had:<br>
                - i5-5200U<br>
                - 8GB DDR3 single-channel (only had one socket, and some guy in simlim square told me that DDR3 16GB didn't exist)<br>
                - 1366-768 IPS<br><br>
                
                but here's 4 reasons why i chose the X250 over the C640:<br>
                - it's <span style="font-size:125%;">rugged</span>, the C640 had too much flex, and it feels like it could break if hold it hard enough)<br>
                - it's <span style="font-size:125%;">smaller</span> (not by thickness of course)<br>
                - it's got a <span style="font-size:125%;">dedicated mechanical dock</span> (and it's frackin' amazing)<br>
                - <span style="font-size:125%;">hotswappable battery</span> (though ngl i think one plastic bit broke that holds the laptop shell together, and even though it still holds together, the 3-cell battery was hard to remove. more on that later)<br>
                - 🔴 <span style="font-size:170%;font-style:italic;text-shadow: 5px 5px #ff000088, -5px -5px #ff000088">trackpoint</span> 🔴<br><br>
                
                the. frackin', trackpoint. as i'm typing on my X230 now i remembered that i just disabled the worthless & gross <span style="color:grey;">trackpad</span> in kubuntu's settings (apparently disabling it in the bios will not give me the trackpoint scroll, so just i'll keep that in mind)
                
                also, i found out around <em>May</em> (during my fyp i think, my memory's quite blurry since the start of 2022) that it wasn't the CPU that was why the <em>performance</em> sucked in the X250. it was the <em>HDD</em>>. running <em>windows 10</em> on a <em>HDD</em>>, and maybe even Ubuntu (with the GNOME DE) on a HDD, was quite... choppy. after investing in a brand new <em><b>2.5" SSD</b></em>, i realised that 5th Gen was still enough for my needs (thinking back then, <span style="font-size:65%;">SGD</span>$65 was quite an expense, though i do remember being paranoid about _used SSDs_ in Carousell)
                
                Before the SSD swap-in, i invested in getting the ThinkPad Mechanical UltraDock (the one with HDMI), and it was awesome. It had the security keys and everything. I could just kensington lock it in the FYP lab and no one could steal it <span style="font-size:70%;">(if they didn't have a ratchet cable cutter)</span>. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                aaaaand yeah i think there was more i just don't recall haha. i was having a honeymoon with my beloved X250, we were having the time of our lives. i loved them, they loved me back. 
                
                <br>
                
                that was.. unfortunately... short-lived....

                <h2>Tragedy: The Ultimate Despairing <span style="font-size:40%">of the fan's ribbon connector</span></h2>
                <br><br>
                to put it simply, i wanted to remove the <b><em>fan & heatsink</em></b> to see what could possibly be behind it.
                <br><br>
                until, with all my <em>lack of environmental threats & clumsiness</em>, <em><b>i broke the ribbon cable connector that connected the fan and the motherboard together</b></em> 😵.
                <br><br>
                that day, <em>i became so sad</em>, i went home in the middle of FYP and got a fever, then few days later, <em><b>literally got COVID-19 alongside my family</b></em> 🦠😵.
                <br><br>
                it was <em>dead</em>, it was <em>gone</em>. i turn it on, it just says "<em><b>Fan Error</b></em>". I became desperate, i searched for new ThinkPads through <em>Carousell</em>, i searched for <em>part replacements</em>. i event went to <em>Sim Lim Square</em>, only to be told that what I have was <em><b>too old</b></em>, and it <em><b>would take weeks</b></em> for that part to arrive to their store, if it exists in the first place.
                <br><br>
                however, my <em>frugal nature & paranoia</em> about getting scammed got the best of me, and i became <em>resigned with the fate</em> 😔.

                <h2>ThinkPad revival 😲</h2>
                <br><br>
                for weeks after FYP, now in my holiday before my final semester starts, i was still searching for a ThinkPad for less than <span style="font-size:65%;">SGD</span>$200. 
                <br><br>
                I was about to purchase a T480 or T470 for around at least <span style="font-size:65%;">SGD</span>$300, but i thought to myself <em>"maybe don't invest so much on this, you already got a good computer, just spend little on what you need. you still want that GPD Pocket 3, yeah?"</em>. i am glad to have goals in life, kinda. 
                <br><br>
                and yes, i do want to own one of those small GPD pocket-sized devices, though not only do i still not have enough money for it, it doesn't seem as rugged as i want to be (unless we're talking about the GPD <em>MicroPC</em>, but i'm not gonna spend about <span style="font-size:65%;">SGD</span>$650 for a Celeron/Pentium, even though it is as powerful as a Core 5th Gen. The cheapest option for it is <span style="font-size:65%;">SGD</span>$480 on Carousell)
                <br><br>
                anyway, getting off from that tangent, somehow I was able to find someone with a <a href="https://carousell.app.link/wdw26PHRDtb">listing</a> for <b><span style="font-size:65%;">SGD</span>$150</b> 🤩 who doesn't live in the west, AND they kinda know their stuff. the seller was a classic indian developer, except he was cooler because he drove a motorcycle (his wedding photos are insane lol). from the start of this article, i mentioned that i got my beloved X230 after church, that's because their location just happened to be near my church, i mean, yeah. the meeting arrangements worked well, the seller was responsive and did his due diligence to check the HDD integrity before we met (it was still running when we met haha).
                <br><br>
                yo fun fact, the X230 is 10 years old, which means that it is exactly half my age. 
                <br><br>
                yesterday after i went home, the first thing i did was (attempt to) <span style="font-size: 175%; text-shadow: 10px 2px #00000099, 20px 4px #00000077, 30px 6px #00000055, 40px 8px #00000033; ">upgrade</span>

<h2 id="upgrades-people-upgrades">Upgrades, people. upgrades.</h2>
<br><br>
ALLLLLRIGHT so i just want things that'll go well with my X230 to reach peak performance. These are it's starting specs:
<ul>
    <li>(<em>un-upgradeable</em>) Intel® Core<sup>TM</sup> i5-3320M CPU @ 2.60GHz</li>
    <li>HGST 320GB HDD</li>
    <li>SK Hynix & Kingston: 2x4GB RAM
        <ul>
            <li>SK Hynix RAM HMT351S6CFR8C-PB 4GB SODIMM DDR3 1333MT/s (<a href="https://www.memorybenchmark.net/ram.php?ram=SK+Hynix+HMT351S6CFR8C-PB+4GB">MemoryBenchmark</a>)</li>
            <li>Kingston RAM 9905428-051.A00LF 4GB SODIMM DDR3 1333MT/s (<a href="https://www.memorybenchmark.net/ram.php?ram=Kingston+9905428-051.A00LF+4GB">MemoryBenchmark</a>)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>(<em>un-upgradeable</em>) Intel® Centrino Advanced-N 6205 [Taylor Peak]</li>
    <li>(<em>un-upgradeable</em>) Ricoh Co. Ltd: PCIe SDXC/MMC Host Controller</li>
    <li>(<em>un-upgradeable</em>) Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd: Integrated Camera [ThinkPad]</li>
    <li>Samsung LCD Monitor SEC3047 1366x768 277x156mm 12.5-inch</li>
    <li>Lenovo BIOS G2ETA3WW (2.63 ) 02/05/2015</li>
    <li>Precision Chiclet Keyboard (top-bar slightly broken)</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
<br><br>
btw, this is all in order of impact, like how much of a noticeable impact it would bring to my experience with my X230.
<br><br>
oh yeah and also, as of <timestamp>2022-Sept-28</timestamp>, i do not intend to do BIOS modding, cuz, well, that looks like a big challenge and i do not want to risk bricking my X230 child. however, i may consider doing it in the future, and may even try corebooting too.

                UPDATE (2022-Oct-11): So I read up about the <em>battery usage differences</em> between TN & IPS, I found everywhere that IPS screen uses up battery much more than TN. Now, idk about you, but I value the battery life over visuals. I really don't need something if it's just gonna use more of my battery. I really prefer the longevity of my X230. So, more or less, i might not consider this upgrade? I won't mark this as complete though, because i might change my mind in the future

                <video src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arialhamed/static/main/video/guides/upgrades/X230/tn-panel.mp4" class="w-100" muted autoplay loop></video><br>
                TN → IPS
                <br><br>
                <b>PROLOGUE</b>: After using this for a while, i realized it was reminiscent of my first ever laptop, which had a TN panel. My X250 that came after that and the C640 after the X250 both had IPS screens, and I loved the experience that they gave.
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, i can't just move out the X250 screen to the X230. This is because the X230 had one of the last LVDS screens, whereas X250 has eDP. idk what those means but basically a new screen will have to wait.
                <br><br>
                <b>GOAL</b>: The <b>cost of replacing the screen would not be cheap</b>, however, i don't have much problem with the current TN screen as it's still very clear to me, and the only flaw is this whitening on the top-left corner of the screen, which is alright. i'm thankful to not do design or color work.

                I found <a href="http://x220.mcdonnelltech.com/resources/">this</a> website commited to upgrading and modifying the X220, which more or less applies to the X230 as well (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4_6LQrmu14">Video by <em>Classic Dome</em></a>).

                UPDATE (2022-Oct-11): IT'S HERE!!! It's almost the same as the other one. It is the <a href="https://memory.net/product/m471b1g73eb0-yk0-samsung-1x-8gb-ddr3-1600-sodimm-pc3l-12800s-dual-rank-x8-module/"><b>M471B1G73<e>E</e>B0-YK0 Samsung 1x 8GB DDR3-1600 SODIMM PC3L-12800S Dual Rank x8 Module</b></a> (<a href="https://www.memorybenchmark.net/ram.php?ram=Samsung+M471B1G73EB0-YK0+8GB">benchmark</a>) from <a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/ddr3l-8gb-ram-crucial-1167510609/">Carousell</a>. It's only difference is the fact that it has that one letter (E instead of D on the other one). As of this typing right now, i'm testing it with that huge Krita file i have for my stickers, and well, it appears as around 16GB in settings, 16GB in the BIOS, 1600Mhz speeds on both 8GB. <b>I'm marking this as done!! 🥰</b>
                <br><hr><br>
                UPDATE (2022-Oct-06): ok so, at least the seller was very communicative in the end and is willing to give a refund if i send it back, which i will. I do learnt something new though:
                <ul>
                    <li>DDR3 -> 1.5V</li>
                    <li>DDR3L -> 1.35V</li>
                </ul>
                Even though i specifically asked the seller before any of this happened what is the voltage of the RAM, they specifically answered back "1.35V", which was what i wanted anyway, bUt i got a 1.5V one instead (which i'm sending back). What kind of ****ing bait & switch is that?
                <br><br>
                ugh, anyway i did find <a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/ddr3l-8gb-ram-crucial-1167510609/">this listing</a>, and i am absolutely doing more research. At the very least, they show the serial numbers, unlike some other listings 🙄. Plus, i think <a href="https://www.crucial.com/scanview/9212E98831D926C3">it is compatible with my X230</a>. It better be, i might meet them tomorrow.
                <br><hr><br>
                UPDATE (2022-Oct-05): i'm simply disappointed, because the 8gb ram that i got was not working. it could likely be due to it being <b>corrupted</b>. As of <timestamp>18:53</timestamp>, the seller has not responded. On the bright side, i found out if i switched out the 4GB RAM with the other one, my RAM will run at 1600MT/s, so that's nice, i guess.
                <br><hr><br>
                UPDATE (2022-Oct-03): alright, i'm doing it cuz i did a recent deposit to my bank account, and so i figured, why not. I have ordered a <a href="">Crucial 8GB DDR3 1600Mhz SODIMM RAM</a> off <a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/selling-8gb-computer-laptop-notebook-ddr3-1600-mhz-sodimm-ram-25-each-1186901424/">Carousell</a>. After i get it and make sure it works fine with the Samsung RAM, where both RAM should be 1600Mhz, hopefully i can configure it work like that, <s>and hopefully the voltage is 1.35 too</s> hopefully the payment matter works out well lol. Now i just gotta wait.
                <br><hr><br>
                UPDATE<span style="font-size: 50%;">not really</span> (2022-Oct-02): So it just occured to me that, perhaps, i do need that full 16GB ram soon, most preferably before school starts on 17 October. I chose the AI route as my 3rd year academic modules, and i need a good computer that can think good, and has good ram. so, um, yeah ari pls remember this haha.
                <br><hr><br>
                UPDATE (2022-Sept-29): So i put in my 8GB and 4GB into my X230, and, well, it seems to work fine, so there's that. idk if it's faster or not but whatever. this is not the max this laptop could do yet though.

                <br><br><br><hr><br>
                UPDATE (2022-Sept-29): ALRIGHT, so i got an mSATA SSD from <a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/samsung-msata-128-gb-ssd-1175558555/">Carousell</a>, and it seems that the listing's removed, so i think they just had 1 left and i somehow got the last one (that is pretty sick). 128GB, <a href="https://www.harddrivebenchmark.net/hdd.php?hdd=SAMSUNG+SSD+SM841N+mSATA+128GB">Samsung SM841N</a>, even though its used, its still quite respectable. When I installed Windows on it, it was surprisingly fast. like, it could be faster than the 2.5" SSD i'm running on right now. even though i'm running on a 3rd gen processor and the mSATA bay was on SATA II (as most forums would mention). 
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, there is a problem where i could only have 1 bootable machine available, because after installing Windows on the mSATA, i had to reinstall Kubuntu on the 2.5" again because it kept on booting to Windows even if i select the 2.5" drive, so i had some suspicion that Windows could have stolen some bandwidth through the 2.5" drive. don't take my word for it though, right now i'm working to find out how to run Windows on a VM, where <a href="/guides/lockdown-browser-on-linux">Lockdown Browser</a> can run on, so that i can go with that initial second option, using 2.5" as /home and using the mSATA for everything else.
                <br><br>
                Ok so that previous paragraph was written around this morning. Just now I found the perfect way to do it. The following is how I did it:<br>
                - Get 2.5" SSD & mSATA SSD and install both into X230<br>
                - Install Linux on 2.5" SSD and do not touch mSATA in installation<br>
                - Shutdown and remove 2.5" SSD and <em>install Windows on the mSATA</em> (btw, very important, if you're gonna install Windows on a ThinkPad, install with <a href="https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht035659">Lenovo's disc images</a>, as longer battery times have been reported, probably due to custom drivers (source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/">Reddit</a>)).<br>
                - Ensure Windows boot into mSATA when 2.5" SSD is not inside<br>
                - The default boot order for X230 is 2.5" bay then mSATA bay, so you can put the Linux 2.5" drive back, and test the boot. It should boot into Linux
                <br><br>
                Now by default, my X230 should be able to boot into either OS. I boot into Linux by default, and if i need to boot into Windows, just remove the 2.5" SSD. It's easy because of how the X230 is built, just <b>remove one screw from the bay lid</b>, <b>pull the 2.5" out</b> and <b>turn on the X230</b> to <b>boot into Windows</b>. This may not be so viable for other laptops, maybe not even other mechanical-gen ThinkPads such as the X250 where it requires removing the entire bottom plate to remove the 2.5" storage (let's not even mention about the hidden 2242 SATA SSD inside the X250)
                <br><hr><br>
                UPDATE (2022-Sept-28): i found one mSATA on Carousell but i'm not gonna share the link lol
                <br><hr><br>
                UPDATE: I already have a 480GB SanDisk SSD when I was upgrading my X250 before it broke, which I installed Kubuntu on it, and vscode, and, in turn, writing this guide (or kinda blog now that i look at it) right now. Right now, i am looking at 128GB mSATA SSDs on Carousell. Such a sexy, suitable size, eh? Once i get it, i will also wait for a better WiFi card (cuz i don't dare to mingle with the keyboard ribbon cable so much lol), which btw is the next upgrade i'm after.
                <br><hr><br>
                <b>PROLOGUE</b>: This X230 came with a crummy 320GB HDD, created by now-defunct HGST. The seller was adamant in wanting to make sure the HDD was fine (and it is), though i already know i was gonna switch it out with an SSD
                <br><br>
                I have 2 options: Only switch out 2.5" HDD with a 2.5" SSD <em>OR</em> add in an mSATA drive into the (probably) available mSATA slot (which is next to the WiFi card) and add in a larger capacity HDD (most probably 1TB or 2TB)
                <br><br>
                After some contemplation, I realized there are some things that I simply can't do without Windows. So, my goal is a third option: X230's 2.5" storage bay runs on SATA III, whereas the mSATA bay in the X230 is on SATA II, which means that, if both internal storages are SATA SSDs, the 2.5" bay will give faster speeds. This has been a deciding factor on what I would do for what I need
                <br><br>
                <b>GOAL</b>: 2.5" SSD <b>and</b> mSATA SSD. The 2.5" SSD would likely be larger in size (aka preference lol), so Linux would be installed into the 2.5" SSD, whereas Windows 10 would be installed on the mSATA

                UPDATE (2023-Sept-19): I was able to hunt down a Sierra Wireless AirPrime MC7750 Qualcomm 4G in Carousell for an affordable price of $12. Linux detects it so I guess that's a win for me! Next up are some WWAN antennas & a simba data plan.
                <br><hr><br>
				UPDATE (2023-Mar-24): So, i found a carousell listing, and it is exactly the best WiFi card for the X230: <b>The Intel Wireless AC-7260</b>.<br><br>Before going out to deal with the seller, I did the deed of <b>giving my X230 <a href="https://1vyra.in/">1vyrain</a></b>, and by the grace of God, it lived through it!

                UPDATE (2022-Oct-09): So, i have done a lot of googling, and it all (kinda) paid off. I found <a href="https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/ibm-thinkpad-users-group.535309/post-58630945">this SG hardwarezone post</a> that tells me much more about WWAN. I thought there was no hope for WWAN but apparently it is possible to add a 3rd antenna. I personally think that that's a bit hard, not to even include the fact that I have a webcam that I still need because I have online meetings.

                There are better WiFi cards that I could install, but that requires me to <a href="https://superuser.com/a/1344X230 mSATA608">mod the BIOS</a>.
                <br><br>
                UPDATE (2022-Sept-28): When i opened up my X230 to install the mSATA i realized i couldn't find the 3rd wire.

I cannot have the best card (without modding), and not only is modding the BIOS a huge challenge, the cost for the BIOS modding kit <b>&</b> the cost of getting that antenna, and also the thought of having to dismantle the screen would send me chills (btw, ari, take note of <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/M-2-2230-Key-A-A-E-to-mini-PCIE-WiFi-Bluetooth-Adapter-for-NGFF-AX200-AX210-Card-/283744526172">this</a>, probably still needs BIOS modding though). <br>With that said, the WiFi card will be marked <em><b>un-upgradeable</b></em>. Kinda sad, but it's fine, i'm not all out for fast WiFi speeds. I'm just content enough as this X230 can connect to 5Ghz WiFi anyway.

                UPDATE (2022-Oct-04): So i found <a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/ake-usb3-0-card-express-54mm-62080255/">this listing</a>, and also found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qber4iyUShM">this video</a>, so, well, maybe, idk.
                <br><br>
                <b>PROLOGUE</b>: My X230 has an ExpressCard slot, and only recently I have googled a lot about it. It was basically Thunderbolt before Thunderbolt. In fact, some laptop models have ExpressCard slots that go at PCIe speeds <span style="font-size: 65%;">(i think)</span> I think the X230 doesn't have extremely high speeds but still respectable <span style="font-size: 65%;">(i think, i don't have any expresscards to test this yet)</span>
                <br><br>
                Anyway, i have seen quite a lot of options online, and for now, I think I would settle for the following goal:
                <br><br>
                <s><b>GOAL</b>: <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000281807808.html">USB 3.0 2 Ports ExpressCard</a></s>
                <br><hr><br>
                I would like to cancel that because i read a lot online that the existence of USB 3.0 ports on an ExpressCard device backfired its purpose. and also, i heard that even the 2 Ports version still overheated like the 3 ports version, and people just wanted more USB-A, so people didn't like ExpressCard. That's my version of the story, take it with a grain of salt.<br><br>My perspective to just getting a USB port ExpressCard, which is basically just replacing the ExpressCard slot, was not right on hindsight. There are <a href="/resources/expresscard">so many choices for ExpressCard</a>, that it would just be unwise for me to just suddenly go full mainstream-practical. That's not me! I have a ThinkPad, for pete's sake, i will go different, because being different is <em>me</em>!
                <br><hr><br>
                So, i'm gonna have multiple goals <span style="font-size: 10%; margin-left: -36em;">just like how i want multiple men to dump their hot yoghurt inside of me</span>, and i'm gonna have different use cases. I know for a fact that of all the other upgrades here (besides the madness upgrades), this ExpressCard upgrade(s) will be the hardest due to low demand and also low reselling of reliable manufacturers (such as StarTech, and occasionally SanDisk & HP).

                UPDATE (2022-Nov-05): So i bought this a new charger, because now that i'm back to school, I began to frequent staying back in school to use the energy here, and the aircon (cuz IT school lol), but my current Kuula 65W charger is only enough to charge my laptop, but it isn't able to charge it alongside my powerbank(s), so I was able to get this <a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/ugreen-100w-gan-charger-4-port-usb-c-multiport-charger-4-port-usb-fast-charger-power-adapter-1159350339/">UGREEN 100W GaN Charger</a>, and damn is it an absolute powerhouse. Built with a metal (probably) sandblasted finish, it packs a great chonk and power. It is amazing, and it just boosts my dopamine so much that I am depending on only one power outlet. 
                <br><br>
                Now up next on my crosshairs is that one <a href="https://www.laptop-battery.com.sg/buy-laptop-battery-lenovo-4919.html">9-cell battery</a> that I saw being sold on Carousell amongst other things...

                UPDATE (2022-Oct-05): I received the <a href="https://shopee.sg/45W-65W-90W-100W-USB-Type-C-PD-Charging-Cable-Cord-USB-C-Plug-Converter-to-Laptop-Power-Adapter-Connector-for-Universal-Laptops-i.268068206.2955272970">usb-c to barrel cable</a>, and well, it works pretty well. It has a nice texture to the cable which makes it nice to hold <em>and</em> its also very easily coilable (easy to pack). I'm also fine with the current battery, combined with the 65W charger, i think i'll just mark this section as done!
                <br><br>
                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arialhamed/static/main/images/blogs/upgrades/X230/battery-6-cell.jpg" class="w-100"><br>
                <b>PROLOGUE</b>: The battery that I got with this X230 is already pretty good. In fact, it has pretty good health! Apparently, the seller got it replaced last year, so it's good. Due to this, the battery itself can be ignored for now, though maybe not for too long, since i realize that it is not an OEM battery 🤨 it's unbranded, not even one from <a href="https://greencell.global/en/standard-batteries/356-laptop-battery-42t4861-for-ibm-lenovo-thinkpad-x220-x230.html#specification">Green Cell</a>.
                <br><br>
                btw i think the X230 external battery is the only one in the laptop (and including the CMOS battery of course). like, there is no other internal battery like the X250.
                <br><hr><br>
                Anyway, next is the cable. Now, i'm not sure how to feel about the barrel connector, because I still have a strong preference to the square plug like the one from the X250, but it shouldn't be too much of an issue. 
                <br><br>
                <b>GOAL</b>: There is a barrel connector (7.9mm-5.5mm) to USB-C cable on <a href="https://shopee.sg/45W-65W-90W-100W-USB-Type-C-PD-Charging-Cable-Cord-USB-C-Plug-Converter-to-Laptop-Power-Adapter-Connector-for-Universal-Laptops-i.268068206.2955272970">Shopee</a> that i want so that i don't have to carry that bulky-ass adapter around. What a coincedance that my greatest USB-C GaN charger is 65W, which is just enough for the X230.
                <br><br>
                One thing that I do want to try in the future is to change out the barrel port on the X230 to something else, like maybe to USB-C, or even square plug if that's possible.

				UPDATE (2022-Dec-27): Well, this is complicated. 4 days ago, I got myself an X220 keyboard <b>&</b> palmrest with fingerprint!!

                UPDATE (2022-Oct-03): so, um, i'm beginning to have second thoughts. i might actually be contempt with my current X230 keyboard, because i grew up with this kind of keyboard, from both the X250 & the C640. So, if that <a href="">transparent keyboard comes</a>, and if it looks fine, then i'll consider just getting a simple <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003444697564.html">chiclet keyboard</a> replacement instead. Either keyboards are fine, don't get me wrong, but i think i realy just gotta wait first and see what's good.
                <br><hr><br>
                UPDATE (2022-Oct-01): So, not only was i more and more convinced to get the classic keyboard whenever i watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LaptopRetrospective">Laptop Retrospective's yt videos</a> about the ThinkPads that they have, but i also found <a href="https://shopee.sg/E.H.For-Lenovo-ThinkPad-T410-X220-X220i-T420-Soft-Ultra-thin-Silicone-Laptop-Keyboard-Cover-Protector-i.450343293.7997713841">listing on Shopee</a> about a keyboard cover that i thought wasn't a thing!! So, i found <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003444467383.html">AliExpress item</a>, and if it's the right one (and doesn't require too much modding), i would go proceed to get it!

                <b>PROLOGUE</b>: So, obviously i'm gonna talk about the X220 classic keyboard, but it seems that there is no keyboard cover for the X220 classic keyboard. So, well, the goal's pretty simple:
                <br><br>
                <s><b>GOAL</b>: <a href="https://shopee.sg/For-Lenovo-ThinkPad-X230-I-T-T430-E430c-Laptop-Keyboard-Film-Protective-Pad-Sticker-Cover-for-ThinkPad-E495-T480-L430-T530%EF%BC%8CS430-E330-E335-E430-L330-E445-E430C-E435-E330-E335-i.362900606.21825584257">keyboard cover for X230</a>. <b><em>btw the one in the video above has its function keys functions not align, obviously</em></b>. I can only get the transparent one because the function keys' secondary functions are not linked to most common keyboard covers. for those who say i'm supposed to protect the environment that the thinkpad can hurt, i also don't want any particle that comes from me or the food that i eat to enter the keyboard and just makes it ugly.</s>
                <br><br><br>
                <s>HOWEVER, i do want to consider replacing the the row that has the volume buttons, the black button (for ThinkVantage) and the power button. For some reason, the microphone mute button is pushed in, the power button is off-centre? and the rest of the buttons on that first row is just not what it feels like it should look like. So i may want to look that up.</s>
                <br><hr><br>
                I realize that my X230 doesn't come with a fingerprint reader. I have found <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000112730401.html">this in AliExpress</a>, which comes with both the palmrest and the fingerprint reader that's inside.

                UPDATE (2023-Sept-19): I found an interesting listing in Carousell, a <a href="https://dl.dell.com/manuals/all-products/esuprt_display_projector/esuprt_display/dell-s2340l_user%27s%20guide_en-us.pdf">Dell S2340L Monitor</a> for $10. I have been using it for a few days now and, well, it is AWESOME. So much better than that COBY TV that I used to use. The only thing that it is lacking are VESA mounting holes, but I found an adapter for that already. Quite ironic that the adapter is almost 3 times the cost of the monitor hahahha. But hey, i love it, it is so clear, IPS, 1080p, more than what I could ever expect for $10!!
                <br><hr><br>
                <b>PROLOGUE</b>: I have an external monitor (which used to be the family TV but no one in my home watches TV anymore lol), and it's VESA compatible.

				UPDATE (2022-Nov-16): So, as it turns out, I got another dock that the X230 can settle on, and this one is so much better. It is the <b>ThinkPad Ultrabase Series 3</b>, and what makes this better is the Ultrabay, where I can slot in a 9mm HDD with a caddy, and with that it can reach speeds way much faster than the default USB 2.0 that both the Mini Dock & Ultrabase only has! It is great, as now there is basically a hidden HDD inside my dock now, and it definitely doesn't feel slow at all (as it is SATAII speed, which is much faster compared to USB 2.0 speed). Not much else to say besides of that awesome feature! 🥰
				<br><hr><br>
                With all this said, and with my new lovely <em>ThinkPad Mini Dock Series 3</em>, i will check this upgrade as done!! 🥰
                <br><br><br><hr><br>
                <b>GOAL</b>: <b>ThinkPad Mini Dock Series 3</b> (<a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/sg/en/accessories/pd008390-thinkpad-mini-dock-series-3-overview">Overview</a>, <a href="https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkPad_Mini-Dock_Series_3">ThinkWiki</a> & <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arialhamed/static/main/pdf/tp_minidock_series3-setupposter.pdf">Setup Poster</a>).<br>
                UPDATE (2022-Oct-01): so i got it lol. since i got it while i was still tapped-in in the MRT when the seller gave it to me, plus it was wrapped in cling-film, so i couldn't immediately test it. however, it was promising, and i was right to assume that the top right thing in the picture was adjustable. not only that, <em>it came with the key!!</em> i have a piece of history in my hands! 😁 the seller is great since they packaged it in cling-film, since it just happened to be raining cats & dogs today 😅. The only thing that (kinda) limits me now is the 90W requirement <span style="font-size: 60%;">(i think)</span>, but remembering from X250's docking station, it probably doesn't really matter.
                <br><br>
                so i got home, i plugged in all that is immediately available to me, which are a Lenovo Optical Mouse (not gonna use it so much lol), the VGA to my ext. monitor, my RJ-45 Ethernet cable, the 65W 20V charger that came with the X230, and last but not least, my Kensington Lock cable. <br>Just like the 40A1 Mech Dock I had docked with the X250, the lock icon & the laptop presence icon lights up! <br>Here's something amazing, the edge on the top-right of the dock is built specifically for the ThinkPads that this Mini Dock Series 3 is compatible with. <br>The rubber foot of my X230 fits <em>juuust</em> right, and as usual, the Mini Dock gives great regard to the battery (and it's various sizes). <br>Related to that, <em>unlike</em> the 40A1 dock, <em>the X230 has no flex when docked without the battery!!!</em>. So, i can just use my X230 without damaging the battery with the heat so much anymore!! <em>THIS IS AMAZING!!!</em>
                <br><br>
                just to put it here, i didn't even realize after googling the thinkwiki after typing that last paragraph that this docking station has one of the widest ThinkPad compatibility ever <span style="font-size: 60%;">(i think)</span>, so here is the compatibility list:
                <ul>
                    <li>W510, W520, W530</li>
                    <li>T400s, T410, T410i, T410s, T410si, T420, T420i, T420s, T420si, T430, T430i, T430s, T430si, T431s, T510, T510i, T520, T520i, T530, T530i</li>
                    <li>X220, X220i, X220 Tablet4, X220i Tablet, <b>X230</b>, X230i, X230 Tablet, X230i Tablet</li>
                    <li>L412, L420, L421, L430, L512, L520, L530</li>
                </ul>
                Now isn't that just amazing? Look at it go!

                <b>PROLOGUE</b>: alright, this is complicated. There are quite a few docking stations & port replicators that I can get compatible with the X230, but i need to make sure that what I get is actually compatible, and also i get what I need.
                <br><br>
                for now, I don't have a focused goal for this.

                UPDATE (2022-Oct-16): omg omg omg, THE STICKER PAPER HAS BEEN PRINTED 😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩 omg i needed to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arialhamed/static/main/pdf/hexagonal%20stickers%20to%20make%20my%20life%20easier%20(X230)%20sRGB%20vert%20for%20printing%202022-Oct-18-1403.pdf">remake my draft</a> to be a bit brighter because indeed it did become burnt as heck when it printed the first time (so now I have 2 copies of it, one of it significantly darker lol). I'll post a pic soon with the stickers on!
                <br><hr><br>
                UPDATE (2022-Oct-14): THE CAMERA COVER IS HERE and it's material is surprisingly good. I have my own [final draft](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arialhamed/static/main/images/hexagonal%20stickers%20to%20make%20my%20life%20easier%20(X230)%20sRGB.png) for the stickers to print next week in school (if they have color 😓, i think they have, just gotta pay more).
                <br><hr><br>
                UPDATE (2022-Oct-11): THE STICKER PAPER IS HERE!!! more updates once i print & paste some stickers to my X230.
                <br><hr><br>
                UPDATE (2022-Oct-04): i ordered some matte sticker paper, the seller on Carousell is obviously a youthful and bright person, the conversation with them is a sight for sore eyes. can't wait to put a print on after printing hehe (note: use inkjet printer for matte sticker paper). i hope it aligns properly. i'm also overlapping the existing logos because <em>they're upside-down</em> when the lid is up. it's such an interesting detail because i see the exact opposite with my X250, where the logos are right-side up when the lid is open. I found <a href="https://tpenguinltg.wordpress.com/2016/08/18/logo-orientation-matters/">a pretty interesting blog</a> where the author thinks otherwise 🧐.
                <br><br>
                Oh i might also paste something on the palmrest, or maybe even spray hydrophobic spray on the palmrest. Maybe a reinforced sticker or something.

                GOAL (2023-Sept-19): After using the C640 & a C340 that my dad found in the trash, I still end up going back to the X230 just because of the appeal of so many different factors, such as the ruggedness, the keyboard, the docking station options, not to mention the seamless integration with Linux. So, I found myself asking, as a 20yo NEET (as of 2023-Sept-19), I decided that when I eventually get a job or any form of pay above a thousand, I will invest in a quad-core motherboard of the X230!
                <br><br>
                This still comes down to consulting advice on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/">r/thinkpad</a>, especially when it comes to the type of CPU that I want, and which AliExpress vendor is reliable. Nevertheless, I found myself using this X230 longer than I expected (which is awesome), so this upgrade will definitely benefit me in the long run.

                look at that. wth. what is up with the engineers that fixed this laptop when the seller still had it. no wonder the keyboard power button and the mute button is janked too.

                aight, so hear me out.<br>
                what if mini-monitor<br>
                but vga<br>
                and you can walk with the laptop while still using it<br>
                and i would primarily use it for youtube while i do other stuff like expanding this website<br>
                <br><br>
                another "upgrade" that i realise that sounds insane but intriguing is to make <em><b>an altered version of the 2.5" drive bay</b></em>. perhaps i could custom make one so that it <em><b>doesn't require screws</b></em> to hold it in place. that's only possible if i have a 3D printer though.
