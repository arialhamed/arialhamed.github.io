# if i had a 3D printer...

### i would do some insane things..

This is basically a page for me to keep write down and preserve my ideas whenever I suddenly think of them. 

This is just another hahpost page basically, and it will always continue to grow (unless i forget about it)

I may think a bit more than 3D printing, like sewing, which i really want to learn. I want to learn both 3D modelling & sewing (as of 2022-Oct-09), and damn there are a lot of resources online for both.

## ideas
these ideas are mine, but public, cuz if it was a million dollar idea i wouldn't put it here:
- **ExpressCard empty tray to put random stuff inside**.
    - i mean, it's pretty simple, and it's a really great & practical option for ExpressCard. just an empty tray to put in stuff, maybe like:
        - a few small screwdrivers (one phillips, one flathead, one torx), 
        - one microSD to SD adapter, 
        - 1 or 2 microSD cards,
        - definitely a SIM card pin &
        - the microSIM frame,
        - maybe those keys too. damn this sounds useful.
- random stuff that hold other stuff to stick onto the laptop lid.
    - like if <a href="https://shopee.sg/Portable-Laptop-Extension-Stand-Multifunctional-Bracket-Double-Screen-Interactive-Magnetic-Aluminum-Alloy-Side-Mount-Phone-Holder-i.549899459.11759743580">this magnetic phone holder that you can paste to the back of your laptop</a> exists, then there should be other stuff that you can just slap onto the back of your laptop to hold.
- customized laptop cases.
    - for whatever current portable workstation i use, definitely requires sewing.
- laptop replacement parts (so here's a list).
    - X230 palm rest _with fingerprint reader (exists)_ & _without touchpad (doesn't exist)_.
    - X230 screwless disk drive bay (like maybe it lets go in a switch).
    - X230 bottom shell _with a built-in stand_ because just pasting one on the X230 will make it not fit in a dock.
- an ultra-portable video game controller
    - something like the horipad but not really that. it will have the following features
        - retractable joysticks & triggers that
            - the joysticks will descent into the controller
            - the triggers will flip inward (it will be thin)
        - connection choices
            - Bluetooth
            - 2.4Ghz via dongle
            - Wired via USB-C
        - usb-c (let's do our collective effort to phase out microUSB, and USB A for that matter lol)
        - rechargeable (duh, def needs more than a 3D printer at this point)
        - maybe a phone holder?
- a new standard of power, internet & security for public and private use
    - so i have this insane idea: why not create a form factor of a cable connection between maybe an outlet type thing, and through that, it can carry power to charge a device like a laptop, _and_ (just like powerline) it can deliver high-speed internet. To top it off, it can also lock to it to prevent theft, on both ends of the cable.
    - i don't think anyone would ever make this idea into a possibility, because there are just too many factors to take into account
        - is it compatible everywhere?
        - is the internet safe and secured in that network?
        - will that plug even deliver internet?
        - what if there is no power to the building?
        - how feasable it is for the user to lock and unlock both ends of the cable all the time they want to secure their device to the outlet?
    - i am so glad i know about the design process and the current market.
