## Follow-up of the ThinkPad 550BJ

So yesterday i received the IBM ThinkPad 550BJ. A 1993 laptop with an integrated Canon BubbleJet Printer.

It handled shipping well with no damages. However some exterior was already somewhat damaged, but overall the laptop is in OK condition with no major pieces missing. The damages it has are located at the bottom back corners and the top cover has a crack where the hinge properly failed slightly, visible in the next photo on the right.

After exterior inspection i connected it to mains power, but it started giving me weird high-pitched noises and it wouldn't power on. I took a change opening op the now brittle laptop so i perhaps find an issue it was having. With the information on <a href="http://www.komotch2.com/tps/550bj.htm" target="_blank">http://www.komotch2.com/tps/550bj.htm</a> i could disassemble the 550BJ. This was an experience on it's own to me because I've never seen that many ribbon cables and connectors holding the two pieces closely together.

The two sections were connected using 5 flat cables and 5 cable connectors, i wonder how much time assembly took in the factory for this model.

I took out 2 cmos battery's. None of them leaked or exploded. Also the DC-in connector was not properly seated, it was sitting upside down which made me presume this model had been opened before for attempted repairs.

After reassembly the 550BJ did power up, but the monochrome 9.5" STN display was not showing an image. On an external monitor it worked just fine. The printer also was alive, the startup check was ok and it grabbed paper. However sadly there was no hard drive in this machine, so no original software, if anyone could help me with that i would be really happy. My next task is to find an hard drive that fits this laptop. I modified a caddy from a IBM 700c so it could fit inside, but the laptop freezes and refuses to do anything with it. And also it wouldn't spin.

I hope some of you find this post interesting and if anyone wants to see more of something specific let me know. As of now i can boot it into dos using floppy and only have an image on a external monitor. I'm also stuck with the idea of sending it of to LGR, but it will be needing proper restoration first.
