## Coming from a Cis Man

Hello ladies,

I wanted to say that during my time working with people who are trans, with more being MtF, I honestly am to the point in which I think my biases are finally broken. All I see now is beautiful women, who take care and treat themselves with the utmost respect, and that simply want to be treated with dignity.

I started off transphobic like most in my area, and was brought upto fear anything out of the normal. When I started working in retail, this all started to change. Truth be told, it was actually started by one very cute girl who I will call Alex. Alex was cute, funny, quirky, sharp-dressed and had a euphoric personality. To be honest, due to those reasons I tried asking her out, and upon doing so she told me she was trans.

It was shocking at first, however, at that point I didn't care anymore. She was literally as beautiful as any girl I've ever seen, so I was adamantly asking for a date regardless of that fact.

Turns out she had a boyfriend though, but was flattered by me asking anyhow. I don't really know how I didn't notice, but love is blind I guess. But anyhow, her adorable self helped me start believing the fact that women are women regardless, and I think all of yall are marvelous!

TL;DR Y'all are all amazing and beautiful women, take care of yourselves. I promise you'll find someone who loves you for who you are, much as I did - even though I got shot down, haha.
