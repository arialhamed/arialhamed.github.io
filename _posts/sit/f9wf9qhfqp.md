2 models of thinking

## Paul-Elder
What is the POV?
What is your assumption? Do you have deeper knowledge to question that assumption?

### The elements
Purpose, questions, point-of-view. Whenever we thinking, we thinkg for a purpose within a point of view, based on assumptions, leading to implications or consequences.

### The standards
Thinkg about your own work. What are those standards? You may think that it is good, but what are you measuring it against?  
Engineers have standards.

### Intellectual traits
We don't work alone, we need to think of different entities. PR, HR, sales, procurement. We need to think of their diverse interests & perspectives.  
Are we able to put ourselves in other people's positions?
