A wired trackball that used the index finger for moving. The way I got this was interesting, the seller's husband wanted to clear out their stuff, so I got this I guess. 

It's very interesting nonetheless, as I have now in my possession a slight piece of history, which means you can very well just google it ðŸ™‚.

If you want to use a trackball, sure you can get this, from there though, it's the matter of wanting an index trackball or a thumb trackball.
