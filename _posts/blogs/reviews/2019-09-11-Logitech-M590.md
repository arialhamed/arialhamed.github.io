One of the best Bluetooth mouse to have ever existed (I allege). The colours of this mouse matched my C640 at the time, so that was a nice combination. 

The reason why I claim its title as the "best Bluetooth mouse" is because of the following list:
- insanely fast pairing speed (Bluetooth),
- ergonomic to the hands,
- silent clicking,
- smooth scroll wheel (and left & right scroll too),
- uses the Unifying software to pair with more devices,
- perfectly weighted,
- & forward/backward buttons for final touch

There was a time when Logitech all kinds of funky ideas, now everything is civil & immaculate like Apple.
