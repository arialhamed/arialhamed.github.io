A one-move solution to elevating your laptop. Somehow I got it at its lower price, and somehow no one knows about this. All I know now is that there is an updated version for it, presumable for larger laptops.

The video which I have below is not a great example of actually how easy it is to deploy the stand, as I used one hand to hold the camera, and the other hand to unfold it. When you put it upright, just split the bottom apart and it's already deployed. Easy as that. It's also not too large too, if you intend to carry it around with your laptop, which for its defining feature, you would likely want this kind of laptop stand.

This product has lived out many other products I have used in the past, so i'm quite inclined to recommend this.
