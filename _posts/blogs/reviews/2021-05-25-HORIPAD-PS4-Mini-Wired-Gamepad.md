So i got this because I really wanted to have a wired controller. Lo and behold, I find one on <a href="https://www.amazon.sg/gp/product/B07XV1GRZX" target="_blank">Amazon</a> for less than SGD$15 (without shipping) during the COVID-19 pandemic. I don't have a PS4 though, but it's also compatible with PC as well. For Steam just let in compatibility for PS4.

It came in a nicely packed package, along with the signs that Playstation did officially allow this controller to be made, which is probably why PC/Steam reads it as a Playstation controller and the actual Dualshock glyphs are on the controller. So it's been ordained as an alternative to the Dualshock from Sony themselves! 

_&lt; insert talk about how it's built and it's target audience here &gt;_
