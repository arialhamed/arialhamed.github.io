DISCLAIMER: The exact that of me obtaining the X250 is unknown, though the year is correct, whereas the month & day is estimated to a certain school term.

### First impressions

Also known as "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnQJMezBIkQ">The Better X240</a>", The ThinkPad X250 was the successor of the X250, and the second laptop to have first left from the original design that was last from X230.

I have acquired a ThinkPad X250 (Type 20CL) from a Carousell seller in about 2018, that was when I was starting out as my secondary school's first batch of Computing students in Sec 3, and there was only 4 of us. I chose to get a ThinkPad because it was a common, if not, the only laptops that I saw in my secondary school back then. In all honesty, i don't know why i bought the X250 at <span style="font-size:65%">SGD</span>$350, cuz it's worth <span style="font-size:65%">SGD</span>$200. It's a regret that was, well, ok i guess, i was a noob in money & computer.

The best DDR3 RAM available for the X250 is one 16GB RAM that comes with it when ordered (<a href="https://memory.net/product/4x70j32868-lenovo-1x-16gb-ddr3-1600-sodimm-pc3l-12800s-dual-rank-x8-replacement/">original replacement</a>), and one 16GB RAM by Crucial (<a href="https://memory.net/product/ct204864bf160b-crucial-1x-16gb-ddr3-1600-sodimm-pc3l-12800s-dual-rank-x8-module/">CT204864BF160B</a>), and either of them are exceedingly rare and expensive, much more expensive than DDR4 16GB RAM. 

When I first used the ThinkPad X250, I had a very low bar for comparison, because years earlier, I used probably the worst Celeron <s>Acer</s> laptop ever, which could barely run & hold anything. So the fact that I already had 500GB of hard disk drive space was amazing. It was great & fast at first, very satisfactory for what it was, and I obviously tried to game on it from time to time. 

Somehow, I had a good experience with gaming on it, and mine you, I have not replaced the storage yet, so I was still running on a HDD _and_ on Windows. I ran certain games well such as _TES Oblivion_, _Starbound (with optimization mods)_, _Aquaria_, _Doom (and GZDoom)_, and probably many other platformers, such as _Cave Story_.

The screen was pretty good, 1366x768 **_IPS_**, I really liked the display. What else to say?

The one thing that I really didn't like are the speakers. When I disassembled it in the stories below, I saw that the speakers had more rubber stand-offs than anything else on the mobo. It was super tinny & at louder volumes, it would just be static hatred that the X250 shouts at me. So most of the time I just listen with earpieces, or with the external monitor speakers.

### Stories

Something that I have no regrets doing was literally bringing it to the waiting room before my prelims for "O" Levels, and playing Oblivion. One of the coolest moments was when my English teacher who was watching me play saw when I unlocked the highest level lock without the Skeleton Key, and that was absolutely sick.

However, as the actual "O" Levels approached, I stored it away in one of my friend's houses so that I won't use it get distracted & play games. Even though I had Computing as an O level paper, i wanted to work on my psuedo-code (on paper), which was alright. Sometimes I wonder if I kept my X250, I would've gotten A1 instead of A2 for Computing.

After a while though, I began, well, not enjoying. Particular because i'm still running Windows on a HDD **&** single-channel DDR3 8GB of RAM. I put it aside after getting the [Yoga C640](/reviews/Yoga-C640) around Q2 of 2019, and up until Q1 of 2022, I never touched it again.

It was when in my internship, I truly learnt a lot about _hardware_, much more than what the academic classes thought. One thing that my supervisor kept on saying whenever he was talking to our customers about upgrading machines, where _switching out a hard-disk drive with a solid-state drive would absolutely boost the speed of the old machine to become more than usable_. So around the start of [FYP](/blogs/poly-finalyear), I decided dust out my X250 and _boot it again_, and I was able to switch it out with an SSD. Boy was it fast. My gosh, loading times were cut down by so much, everything was super snappy.

My only regret about my X250 was that I misused it for years, by using it as a _PC_, by stowing it away in a shelf, connected to a lot of peripherals, with _almost no ventilation_. I was playing Elder Scrolls Online on it for ages, and this was before the SSD came in, so it wasn't even optimal, though it was still playable with Ethernet & adjusting all visual settings to the lowest. I got very far into that game, past CP1200, haven't played it in about a year ever since the time of this writing.

Anyway, because of this action, I had absolutely & unintentionally decimated the battery life due to all the heat it has faced for endless days back then, so it hold about 23% of it's design capacity (iirc). I can still use it for about as long as 2 sermons, at the very least.

One thing I did to supplement my X250 (besides the SSD) was to get a mechanical dock. There are 3 docks compatible with the X250:
- <a href="https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkPad_Basic_Dock">ThinkPad Basic Dock</a>
- <a href="https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkPad_Pro_Dock">ThinkPad Pro Dock</a>
- <a href="https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkPad_Ultra_Dock">ThinkPad Ultra Dock</a>

I first got the Pro Dock, but it came without keys, then I got the Ultra Dock, which came with the keys _and_ the best part is that it came with HDMI 1.4. Read more in [my review for the Ultra Dock](/reviews/ThinkPad-Ultra-Dock-40A2).

### Unfortunate incident

It was a calm afternoon, in the FYPJ labs, I was there, configuring and looking inside my X250 because I was bored af.

It was my due clumsiness and lack of spatial awareness that has caused me to unintentionally break the fan connector of the fan & heatsink. 

I was devastated, I couldn't boot it back up. I was so upset, that I decided to go home for the day, and I got a fever when I arrived home. I didn't tell anyone because I know for a sugaring fact anyone would say "um, its your fault" like of course, dumbass. It was precious, I loved it, but alas, I knew it was me who killed it.

I only knew how to love it, when I finally let it go.

For the rest of FYPJ, I was stuck to using the Yoga C640. Read more on its review.

### Setting it to sleep, forever

As of this writing, I am actually typing on one of its predecessor, the [ThinkPad X230](/reviews/ThinkPad-X230), while I reminisce of the good times I had with the X250. As now I have gotten a better ThinkPad (yes the X230 is better), I believe I have the ability to finally set the X250 down. Of course I won't sell it, its damn broken, plus I intend to be kind of a collector of ThinkPads.

<hr>

While the X250 did give sub-par performance, with horrible battery life (my fault), impressive screen viewing (IPS is great), and the ruggedness only the ThinkPad and Toughbook can give, 

I will not deny that the X250 has introduced and given me the eyes that value antiquities and awesome things of the past. <span style="font-size:120%;">Great innovations such as the many ThinkPads of the past should never be forgotten.</span>
