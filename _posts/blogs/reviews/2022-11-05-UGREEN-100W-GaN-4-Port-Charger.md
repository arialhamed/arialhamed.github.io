I have been eyeing this for quite a while actually, ever since I saw <a href="{{ page.source_link }}">this listing</a> and many other listings that are also somewhat similar in function. As my final semester in poly starts (though its week 4 by now), I found myself staying back in school more often, like up to 7pm. It's not just the amount of assignments that I have, but its also the fact that in the places where I can study, there are 2 things: air-con, and infinite power that I don't need to pay extra for. Hey we're paying the school fees, so therefore I get to eat da powaa. 

I was using a [65W Kuula charger](/blogs/reviews/Kuula-65W-GaN-Charger-(UK)) that had only 1 USB-C and 1 USB-A, where the USB-C can charge at the max of 65W. Unfortunately, as I went from using the X250 (and the C640) to using the X230, my TDP for my laptop increased from 45W to 65W. That means that I became limited to only using the 1 USB-C port. I tried charging my laptop through the USB-C port while also charging my phone through the USB-A port, the laptop will only detect jumps in energy, which means even though there is enough watts for the X230 to detect it, this will eventually wear out the barely in a blazingly fast speed. So until I got this 100W UGREEN charger, I was limited to only charging peripherals through the laptop like a daisy-chain, and no, bringing another charger is not viable, I just want to bring one charger for all my needs, I don't want to bulk up my bag more than it already is.

As of the last update to this review, I am still very satisfied with it. More or less its a great birthday present for me üòç
