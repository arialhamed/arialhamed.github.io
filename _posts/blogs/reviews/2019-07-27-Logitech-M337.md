Quite an ingenious product, yet grossly undermarketed. I bought this a while back, back when I was still dipping my toes into hardware stuff. I knew Logitech was well known for its desktop peripherals, so I got this one only based off the fact that it was quite cheap around the time.

It's defining feature is the button in the middle, where you can assign certain functions to it using Logitech Options (so Windows-only), and when you press it, it does something. However, here's the surprise, you can hold the button and then move the mouse either up, down, left or right, and it will execute the functions you have assigned it to via Logitech Options! It's very intuitive and interesting, I must say!
