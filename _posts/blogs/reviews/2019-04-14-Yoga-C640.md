### First impressions

It was faster, sure, but it was damn flimsy, it had boot-up problems, the fan made a disgusting sound everytime it would boot-up, and one time, after maintenance officer came to replace the screen, **the screen would have a tendancy to drop off**.

Other than that, it's, well, alright. It's alright good, I would say. You can read all about it in my backed-up PSREF in the interesting information section below.

### Gallery

tbh I won't bother to upload images of it (for now)
