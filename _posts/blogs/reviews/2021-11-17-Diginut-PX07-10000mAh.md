An all-in-one mobile phone charger! How i came across this charger was one time where I saw someone having this very interesting portable charger, where it has 4 built-in charging cables to it. So i found one that isn't over $20 and I got it.

It has 4 outputs and 1 input:
- Lightning _output_ cable
- USB-C _output_ cable
- Micro USB _output_ cable
- USB-A _input_ cable
- USB-A _output_ port

So how is it? Pretty good. It can charger my Samsung J4 4 times and about 2 times for my Oppo A14. Whenever I bring it, it gives me a certain & weird confidence. Like, I can charge my own phone of course, but I can also charge any of my friend's phones, because all of them either use Android _or_ iPhone, which uses either USB-C _or_ Lightning, and I can help give them power (if I really need to). 

The way the cable length is designed is meant so that you carry both the charger & your phone in one hand. It's not much of a problem really.

There's not much to discuss about it, it's a great product with a great idea. Just take note there are many similar products that are either very similar or just clones. They could work just as well as this one, _or_ they could suck, especially if it's a shady brand made in China, or even just unbranded.
