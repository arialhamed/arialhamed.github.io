So i got it, finally, an UltraBase Series 3, and let's just say it's pretty metal.

ngl it's already replaced the Mini Dock that I have, even though the UltraBase has 2 less USB 2.0 ports, it has 1 thing the Mini Dock does not have: _**The Ultrabay**_ (or more specifically, the Serial Ultrabay Slim). 

The default Ultrabay device that an UltraBase would usually come with is a DVD reader/writer, which was what I got. The great thing about this stuff like this is that it is pretty self explanatory what each part of the device is, and one great yet minor detail about the ports behind, is that when looking over the whole device, with a laptop docked on, there is an imprint that shows what each port is from where you're looking at it.

The DVD-RW is an interesting device, the last time i saw one is on a Dell Optiplex that i had to use in my first internship during my diploma years. The first time i saw one was this recorder that my family had, and i remembered using it alot to rip movies from the TV. That was during my CRT days, so I was quite young and I knew how to use DVDs already, alongside CDs (which are almost the same) and cassette tapes.

Anyway, from that tangent, I unfortunately may have some trouble with the DVD-RW drive as there may be a chance it may not be functional. It is detected by both Windows and Linux when attached and at boot, i was able to eject it from both Windows and Linux, but it wasn't able to read any of the CDs or DVDs i still had. All conclusions from this are not good, as this means that either the Ulrabay devices has a firmware glitch, all my CDs and DVDs have bit-rot overtime, or both.

Either way, i don't really intend to keep it on for long though. The main reason why I even bothered to get the UltraBase was because _it can hold a HDD inside the Ultrabay_ with a HDD adapter!!!

As of 2022-Nov-19, the HDD adapter that I have ordered is still on the way. The <a href="https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Ultrabay">ThinkWiki</a> has been very helpful in making sure I purchased the right one. Now the only thing I can do about this UltraBase is hope that my HDD works in the UltraBase in the end. The Ultrabay is so much faster than USB 2.0, so this is going to be a great upgrade!
