Alright time to shit this out. At least ~6 years of playing Starbound and ~4 years of Frackin Universe, has led me to this.. fanfiction, OC diarrhea that i birthed from my mind vagina.

# Dawn of the Nine

A millenia has passed ever since the deaths of our birth planets & galaxies were brought to past, whether be it by internal suffering, by cosmic fate or by the hands of Atrophus. Many civilizations stood tall and flourished among the wars across the universe, yet most were destined to fall. Even in the midst of wars in the past, the greatest of our kinds has brought forth the greatest achievements for all life to enjoy, whether be it the FTL engine, the discovery of magicka, unlocking the powers of the Ancients, and so much more. After the Atrophus was slain by the last survivor of Earth, many societies across the galaxies came together to become one to celebrate. They continued to do so, expanding forth to new galaxies.

To be frank, I thought I was born too late to explore the world. I am glad to be born- umm, rather, created just in time to travel across the universe. My name is Calibri Quark, and I have graduated from The Cosmic Corps. With my certificate & license to go to space, I want to explore the galaxies and contribute to advancements in technology to make the universe a better place to live in. 

Little did I know, as I prepared my dorm to leave, I was met by a fate. A fate that haunted history, a cycle of destruction. Hope dethroned.
