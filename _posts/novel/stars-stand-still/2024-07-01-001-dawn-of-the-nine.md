# Dawn of the Nine
The Light shines throughout Existence, through each planet & galaxy, through every living being.  
The Light binds us all as one.  
The Light binds us, narrator & explorer.  
My story will become your own, and yours will become mine.  
You will live my life through my eyes..  
and you will learn the truth.

## Chapter 1: Calibri
A millenia has passed ever since the deaths of our birth planets & galaxies were brought to past, whether be it by internal suffering, by cosmic fate or by the hands of Atrophus. Many civilizations stood tall and flourished among the wars across the universe, yet most were destined to fall. Even in the midst of wars in the past, the greatest of our kinds has brought forth the greatest achievements for all life to enjoy, whether be it the FTL engine, the discovery of magicka, unlocking the powers of the Ancients, and so much more. After the Atrophus was slain by the last survivor of Earth, many societies across the galaxies came together to become one to celebrate. They continued to do so, expanding forth to new galaxies, hence our lives & fortunes are forever intertwined for generations & generations to come.

To be frank, I thought I was born too late to explore the universe. My name is Calibri Quark, and I was going to graduate from The Cosmic Corps Academy. I did not have much aspirations for my life. I just wanted to make the world run to sustain myself & my family.

Life was average here in Procyon Civil Space Colony. I lived my whole life as a casual Fabricant humanoid, adopted by humans. I had average physical abilities, and mostly average grades besides technology. I did not have many friends in the Academy besides a few short-lived ones that I had to do group projects with. I was.. just surviving in a world. Somehow, I have quite a lot of emotion as a Fabricant, to the point where other Fabricants would ask me to see a doctor when I started crying over assignments that were not my forte, or whenever I would celebrate 

One day, I left my dormitory in the middle of night, the night before my graduation. Somehow, in my own dreams, I felt something. Something was not right. My entire life, I did not have big dreams or great aspirations to change the world, but there was something behind my eyes, an unexplainable itch. I needed to clear my head. 

Yet, today, I felt something that goes beyond what my mind & heart could comprehend. I walked around the void decks of the dormitories, I walked to view the synthetic lake. I knew I was awakened before. I knew that there is life beyond the small towns & hard labour. Was I being awakened again? I looked upon the stars, desperately searching for an answer. This was not the first time I found myself like this. I dared not to reveal myself like this in fear of being scrapped or suspected as having a disease of madness.

Then, I saw a figure made of pure light stood at the other side of the rails I was usually on. It looked humanoid in nature, with no outstanding details, and it too was staring into the stars like me. I would've been scared out of my head and ran away, since it was so unnatural to me. However, there was a peace when I saw the figure, a mix of peace & anxiety in my soul. As I approached it, my emotions fought for dominance. My mind races through each cultural & historical textbook that I've ever read, but none prevail relating to this phenomenon. Without hesitation, it motioned itself to a stance, as if looking at me and reaching out for my hand. I reach out for it's hand, and held it.

## Chapter 2: A Vision

In all my memory, every day was like every other. If it had not appeared before me in that moment, I might have stayed in the Colony, living as a simple Fabricant. The strange form faded before my eyes. Perhaps I'd only dreamed of it, but I was no longer the same. As if from a dream, I awoke to the reality of my existance, the fact that I was.. missing something in me. I knew that I was born a Fabricant, and that I had human parents who love me, and my best friend a D'metra named Akhila, but I could recall nothing else. Was I the only one feeling this way? Was I destined to live out the rest of my days with this void ever consuming? My heart ached for answers. In time, I would discover far more than I wish to learn. 

Before I had time to ruminate further, I felt a tremor beneath my feet. I saw red lights and bright sounds coming from every direction. As I slowly emotionally recovered from the experience with the figure of light, I looked around me where many objects kept shooting out of the sky and into the horizon. Procyon CSC was under a state of emergency.
