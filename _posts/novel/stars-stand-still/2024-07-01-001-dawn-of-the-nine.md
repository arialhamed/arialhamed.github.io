# Dawn of the Nine

The Light shines throughout Creation, through each planet & galaxy, through every living being.  
The Light binds us all as one.  
The Light binds us, narrator & explorer.  
My story will become your own, and yours will become mine.  
You will live my life through my eyes..  
and you will learn the truth.

## Chapter 1: Calibri

A millenia has passed ever since the deaths of our birth planets & galaxies were brought to past, whether be it by internal suffering, cosmic fate or by the hands of Atrophus. Many civilizations stood tall and flourished among the wars across the universe, yet most were destined to fall. Even in the midst of wars in the past, the greatest of our kinds has brought forth the greatest achievements for all life to enjoy, whether be it the FTL engine, the discovery of magicka, unlocking the powers of the Ancients, and so much more. Atrophus, the world-devourer, was slain by the last survivor of Earth. Many worlds across the galaxies came together to become one to celebrate. They continued to do so, expanding forth to new galaxies, hence our lives & fortunes are forever intertwined for generations & generations to come.

To be frank, I thought I was born too late to see the universe. My name is **Calibri Quark**, and I was going to graduate from The Cosmic Corps Academy. I did not have much aspirations for my life. I just wanted to make the world run to sustain myself & my family. My life was average here in Procyon Civil Colony. I lived my whole life as a casual Fabricant humanoid, adopted by humans. I had average physical abilities, and mostly average grades besides technology. I did not have many friends in the Academy besides a few short-lived ones that I had to do group projects with, although I do have some whom I keep close. I am seen as different from my peers, especially amongst other Fabricants. 

One day, I left my dormitory in the middle of night, the night before my graduation. Somehow, in my own dreams, I felt something. Something was not right. My entire life, I did not have big dreams or great aspirations to change the world, but there was something behind my eyes, an unexplainable itch, like something was calling out to me but I'm only getting static. I needed to clear my head. 

In my efforts of elleviating this emotion, I end up feeling something that goes beyond what my mind & heart could comprehend. I walked around the void decks of the dormitories, pacing back & forth. What was this feeling? I decided to visit the colony's synthetic lake. I knew I was awakened before. I knew that there is life beyond the confines of a small compound & hard labour. Was I being awakened again? I looked upon the stars, desperately searching for an answer. This was not the first time I found myself like this. I dared not to reveal myself like this in fear of being scrapped or suspected as having some disease of madness.

Then, I saw a figure made of pure light stood at the other side of the rails I was usually on. It looked humanoid in nature, with no outstanding details, and it too was staring into the stars like me. I would've been scared out of my head and ran away, since it was so unnatural to me. However, there was a peace when I saw the figure, a mix of peace & anxiety in my soul. As I approached it, my emotions fought for dominance. My mind races through each cultural & historical textbook that I've ever read, but none prevail relating to this phenomenon. Without hesitation, it motioned itself to a stance, as if looking at me and reaching out for my hand. I reach out for it's hand, and held it.

## Chapter 2: The Dark Hunger

In all my memory, every day was like every other. If it had not appeared before me in that moment, I might have stayed in the Colony, living as a simple Fabricant. The strange form faded before my eyes. Perhaps I'd only dreamed of it, but I was no longer the same. As if from a dream, I awoke to the reality of my existance, the fact that I was.. missing something in me. I knew that I was an adult Fabricant, and that I had human parents who love me ever since I was 11, but I could recall nothing else of my past. Was I the only one missing a childhood? Was I destined to live out the rest of my days with this void in me ever consuming? My heart ached for answers. In time, I would discover far more than I wish to learn. 

Before I had time to ruminate further, I felt a tremor beneath my feet. I saw red lights and bright sounds coming from every direction. As I slowly emotionally recovered from the experience with the figure of light, I looked around me where many objects kept shooting out of the sky and into the horizon. Procyon CSC was under a state of emergency. 

I ran back to my dorms to see everyone in different states of panic. Some are still in deep slumber, some are hiding under things that they could their hands on. I made a beeline for my drawers, over the shaking & cracking floors. I successfully scooped a small trinket and kept it in my torso. Before I could face the door of my dorm, the window exploded with great force, and the tremor stopped. I was still in shock of high-alert, but I felt something. I felt something that caused my heart to sink. I really did not want to look out of the window. Something was out there, perhaps the very thing that was causing this. Against my better judgement, I approached cautiously to the window as I hear my dormmates from their rooms wail for help.

A large blanket of dark maroon clouds blocked our star. It seemed.. alive. No, my eyes refuse to believe that it was natural. It was as if I was seeing a timelapse of a normal cloud moving in ten times speed. As if the movement of the cloud was not unsettling enough, I lowered my gaze to what was under the clouds, and I gasped in shock. I saw what appeared to be numerous arms, arms made out of who-knows-what, that started from the base of the cloud. It was holding an entire segment of the colony that was miles away, slowly raising it to the clouds. From afar I could make out some of the military drones attempt to shoot the arm. Each drone was shot down by its own shot, as the arms from the cloud deflected it. The sight had me awestruck in terror, and I was frozen in fear & awe.

"Hey!" someone shouted in my direction, "Get out of here and into th-". The voice was cut-off, assuming that they were seeing what I was seeing as well. I briefly looked back at who it was. It was Varia, one of Cosmic Corps' Starcallers. The Lophiiformi was one of the Cosmic Corps' best, and was destined to be the next Grand Starcaller. I often looked up to her, and I was grateful for her to mentor me personally when I moved here. "We need to get out of here, now!" shouted Varia, as she pulled me out of my gaze and back into my alert state. She held & pulled me by my arm with force as we got out of the dorms, where many other Cosmic Associates like me were also running for their lives. The corridor was seemed long, so I began to pick up my pace and tried to match it to Varia's. From one of the rooms in front of us to the right, an explosion blasted through the door

"Lizzie!" Varia & I called out. The crouching body with the Associate uniform who managed to fall out in time was **Kristeria**, a D'metra whom I've met and got close with after we were both pulled in a case that involves us, a lighter & a 5 litre canister of hydrogen. Kristeria made out of her room's explosion miraculously unscathed. "Owww..", she groaned in pain before getting a glimpse on Varia, "I swear that wasn't-". Kris was cut-off by another explosion behind me & Varia. Varia picked up Kris in a heartbeat, and dashed us out of the compound. 

"We are not sure what this entity wants from us, but there are secrets that we have kept secret for a millenia", Varia told us as we
