## Chapter 2: The Dark Hunger

In all my memory, every day was like every other. If it had not appeared before me in that moment, I might have stayed in the Colony, living as a simple Fabricant. The strange form faded before my eyes. Perhaps I'd only dreamed of it, but I was no longer the same. As if from a dream, I awoke to the reality of my existance, the fact that I was.. missing something in me. I knew that I was an adult Fabricant, and that I had human parents who love me ever since I was 11, but I could recall nothing else of my past. Was I the only one missing a childhood? Was I destined to live out the rest of my days with this void in me ever consuming? My heart ached for answers. In time, I would discover far more than I wish to learn. 

Before I had time to ruminate further, I felt a tremor beneath my feet. I saw red lights and bright sounds coming from every direction. As I slowly emotionally recovered from the experience with the figure of light, I looked around me where many objects kept shooting out of the sky and into the horizon. Procyon Colony Station IV was under a state of emergency. 

I ran back to my dorms to see everyone in different states of panic. Some are still in deep slumber, some are hiding under things that they could their hands on. I made a beeline for my drawers, over the shaking & cracking floors. I successfully scooped a small trinket and kept it in my torso. Before I could face the door of my dorm, the window exploded with great force, and the tremor stopped. I was still in shock of high-alert, but I felt something. I felt something that caused my heart to sink. I really did not want to look out of the window. Something was out there, perhaps the very thing that was causing this. Against my better judgement, I approached cautiously to the window as I hear my dormmates from their rooms wail for help.

A large blanket of dark maroon clouds blocked our star. It seemed.. alive. No, my eyes refuse to believe that it was natural. It was as if I was seeing a timelapse of a normal cloud moving in ten times speed. As if the movement of the cloud was not unsettling enough, I lowered my gaze to what was under the clouds, and I gasped in shock. I saw what appeared to be numerous arms, arms made out of who-knows-what, that started from the base of the cloud. It was holding an entire segment of the colony that was miles away, slowly raising it to the clouds. From afar I could make out some of the military drones attempt to shoot the arm. Each drone was shot down by its own shot, as the arms from the cloud deflected it. The sight had me awestruck in terror, and I was frozen in fear & awe.

"Hey!" someone shouted in my direction, "Get out of here and into th-". The voice was cut-off, assuming that they were seeing what I was seeing as well. I briefly looked back at who it was. It was **Varia, one of Cosmic Corps' Starcallers**. The Lophiiformi was one of the Cosmic Corps' best, and was destined to be the next Grand Starcaller. I often looked up to her, and I was grateful for her to mentor me personally when I moved here, being my guiding light, figuratively & literally. "We need to get out of here, now!" shouted Varia, as she pulled me out of my gaze and back into my alert state. She held & pulled me by my arm with force as we got out of the dorms, where many other Cosmic Associates like me were also running for their lives. The corridor was seemed long, so I began to pick up my pace and tried to match it to Varia's. From one of the rooms in front of us to the right, an explosion blasted through the door

"Kris!" Varia & I called out. The cowering body with the Associate uniform who managed to fall out in time was **Kristeria**, a D'meteri whom I've met and got close with after we were both pulled in a case that involves us, a lighter & a 5 litre canister of hydrogen. Kristeria made out of her room's explosion miraculously unscathed, despite being made out of flammable plants. "Owww..", she groaned in pain before getting a glimpse on Varia, "I swear that wasn't-". Kris was cut-off by another explosion behind me & Varia. Varia picked up Kris in a heartbeat, and dashed us out of the compound. 

"We are not sure what this entity wants from us, but there are secrets & powers that we have kept for a millenia", Varia told us as she lead us to the Academy hangar "We need you few to take these and get out of here". Other Cosmic Corps students were there being lead by other Starcallers. "Varia! Are you sure these are the ones?" **Starcaller Onoda** exclaimed in our direction with a megaphone. The Rahmantisi Starcaller Onoda is Varia's colleague and Kristeria's mentor. "I'm sure these are the ones, that's what Proc-", Varia paused as she looked back to us, halted herself & pushed us forward closer to the hangar. Kristeria & I looked back at her as she casts a spell to create a large shield, covering probably the entire hangar. It didn't take long to see what caused her to react quickly. The colony's residential district was falling through the anomalous clouds, towards where it once original stood. "Don't look back, I got this!" Varia shouted while keeping an eye on the building that is barreling towards the ground. Kris & I kept on running and took shelter with other Cosmic Corps members in the hangar. I looked around for Onoda, but he was already supporting Varia's shield. A thunderous wave of sound, wind & debris then hit us. 

The impact was so intense that it shook the entire hangar, but Varia's shield supported by Onoda has protected all of us from the debris. I could not comprehend how much people might have been crushed by the buildings being upside-down and fall flat into the ground like that. The dust is still blowing while we all kept our eyes on the crash in silence. The moment was brief, filled with solemnity but anxiety.

"Get them in starships, I need to search for survivors!" Onoda yelled. "Don't go alone, get some of the Protectors to follow you!" Varia responded before gesturing towards the hangar. Indeed, a few Protectors from the Corps ran to Onoda. It took me a second to realize that the red living clouds were still above us. Varia reached us and pulled me & Kristeria to a ship on the roof of the hangar. The ship was one that Varia has used for her Starcaller Trials, so it was built by her, from the engine to the weaponry. Before I got onto the ship, I took a good look at Procyon Colony for the final time. I heard the screams of pain amongst the sirens. It was only now that I realized how much of what I lived in all my life was lost. All in a short moment, less than a day. Before I got to reflect upon what I've done here in this station, I started to notice some appendages extending from the clouds. I hopped in, closing the hatch. 

"Are you two strapped in?" Varia said while she activates her old ship. Before I could respond, another shockwave sends us. I could barely get my words out that day. I stumbled back up and peaked at the rear view windows. "What do you see, Bri?" I heard Kristeria said in my direction. I could barely focus on it, as I was so discombobulated at this point of time. However, another pump of adrenaline hits me as I noticed hands. Large hands approaching us from behind. The red cloud wanted us. Varia was not having any of it and immediately stepped on it. I fell again when Varia's ship left the ground at top speed, so I crawled to a seat next to Kristeria. After finally settling and letting Kristeria help me, I got to take a good look at the world outside of the windows. The dark-red clouds were much lower now as it was moving down upon infrastructure. I noticed now what kind of entity this is after seeing our academy's interaction with this cloud. Rather, a lack there of, as where the academy was gone. I recalled now that only less than half of the residential district fell down. 

This dark-red cloud was consuming. It was consuming everything.
