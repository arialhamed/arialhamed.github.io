## Races
- Characters listed here are when the story starts
- **Fabricants**
    - Origin
        - _An android species_. The Fabricants reated by an unknown ancestor race that existed before humans, meant to predict the future, yet the creators end up destroying themselves due to internal conflict, leading the Fabricants to fend for themselves in The Sandbox Galaxy. 
        - One Fabricant unlocked themselves and awakened the race to venture out into the universe using the ancestor races' abandoned technology. 
        - The Fabricants include humanoids, animals, plants, structures, etc, but only humanoids have survived throughout the generations. 
        - The secret that only the Fabricant creators and Tahoma knew was that each humanoid have a lifeforce inside them that resembles that of a human.

## Artefacts
- Matrix of Ascension
    - A relic long forgotten, the secret power behind the Cai's ability to destroy the Atrophus. Before Cai's death, Cai has split the relic into 9 different pieces, and went across Creation hiding those in multiple different planets, commissioning the different races to hide them for all eternity until the next extinction event (note: need to write down prophecy poem about this)
        - Just like how history is, even though Cai may have done this as a good gesture on paper, they may have not done it kindly in practice to some races heheh
- Divine Core
    - Ever since Atrophus, Cai has had descendants for 40 generations across different species. Each descendant have a Divine Core, that when coordinated with 
- FTL technology
    - Started from Delacroix Inc. then was made open-source for all to use & explore the Universe

    - A staff that wields the powers of Atrophus. A side-product created from Aninharle Moon Laboratory. Used by the crew later for something, then destroyed cuz lotr stuff idk
