<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse</em></span>  
Don't know what's going on  
Don't know what went wrong  
Feels like a hundred years  
I still can't believe you're gone  
So I'll stay up all night  
With these bloodshot eyes  
While these walls surround me with the story of our life  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
I feel so much better  
Now that you're gone forever  
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all  
I'm not lying, denying that I feel so much better now  
That you're gone forever  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse</em></span>  
Now things are coming clear  
And I don't need you here  
And in this world around me  
I'm glad you disappeared  
So I'll stay out all night  
Get drunk and fucking fight  
Until the morning comes  
I'll forget about our life  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
I feel so much better  
Now that you're gone forever  
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all  
I'm not lying, denying that I feel so much better now  
That you're gone forever  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Bridge</em></span>  
First time you screamed at me  
I should have made you leave  
I should have known it could be so much better  
I hope you're missing me  
I hope I've made you see  
That I'm gone forever  
  
And now it's coming clear  
That I don't need you here  
And in this world around me  
I'm glad you disappeared  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
I feel so much better  
Now that you're gone forever  
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all  
I'm not lying, denying that I feel so much better now  
That you're gone forever  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Outro</em></span>  
And now you're gone forever  
And now you're gone forever
