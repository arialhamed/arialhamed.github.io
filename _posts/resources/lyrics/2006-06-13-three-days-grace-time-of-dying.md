<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse</em></span>  
On the ground I lay  
Motionless in pain  
I can see my life flashing before my eyes  
Did I fall asleep  
Is this all a dream?  
Wake me up  
I'm living a nightmare  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Pre-chorus</em></span>  
I will not die (I will not die)  
I will survive  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
I will not die, I'll wait here for you  
I feel alive when you're beside me  
I will not die, I'll wait here for you  
In my time of dying  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse</em></span>  
On this bed I lay  
Losing everything  
I can see my life passing me by  
Was it all too much  
Or just not enough?  
Wake me up  
I'm living a nightmare  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Pre-chorus</em></span>  
I will not die (I will not die)  
I will survive  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
I will not die, I'll wait here for you  
I feel alive when you're beside me  
I will not die, I'll wait here for you  
In my time of dying

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Interlude</em></span>  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus (x2)</em></span>  
I will not die, I'll wait here for you  
I feel alive when you're beside me  
I will not die, I'll wait here for you  
In my time of dying
