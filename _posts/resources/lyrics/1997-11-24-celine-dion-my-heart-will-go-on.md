<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 1</em></span><br>
Every night in my dreams<br>
I see you, I feel you<br>
That is how I know you go on<br>

Far across the distance<br>
And spaces between us<br>
You have come to show you go on<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span><br>
Near, far, wherever you are<br>
I believe that the heart does go on<br>
Once more, you open the door<br>
And you're here in my heart<br>
And my heart will go on and on<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 2</em></span><br>
Love can touch us one time<br>
And last for a lifetime<br>
And never let go 'til we're gone<br>

Love was when I loved you<br>
One true time I'd hold to<br>
In my life, we'll always go on<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span><br>
Near, far, wherever you are<br>
I believe that the heart does go on<br>
Once more, you open the door<br>
And you're here in my heart<br>
And my heart will go on and on<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Outro</em></span><br>
You're here, there's nothing I fear<br>
And I know that my heart will go on<br>
We'll stay forever this way<br>
You are safe in my heart and<br>
My heart will go on and on<br>
