<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 1</em></span><br>
Excuses, excuses are all that I hear<br>
All I can see when I look in the mirror<br>
I can't escape all these thoughts in my mind<br>
They're waiting to haunt me night after night<br>
<br>
I feel it in my bones and everything I know<br>
It's underneath my skin and it won't let go<br>
They know me all too well, but only time will tell<br>
If this is who I am, do I know myself?<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Pre-chorus</em></span><br>
Don't forget your life's your own, don't ever let it go<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span><br>
In the heat of the moment, when fear has you frozen<br>
You're crashing and burning, when life's at its coldest<br>
Don't fall too far from who you are<br>
They can cut us but we'll wear our scars<br>
In the heat of the moment, when fear has you frozen<br>
You're crashing and burning, when life's at its coldest<br>
Don't fall too far from who you are<br>
Try to tear us apart but know that we'll wear our scars<br>
(Try to tear us apart but know that we'll wear our scars)<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 2</em></span><br>
Denial, Denial is all that I've known<br>
Holding me hostage I'm never alone<br>
Fighting for air, I'll fight to survive<br>
My soul's not for sale I won't pay the price<br>
I feel it in my bones and everything I know<br>
It's underneath my skin but I won't let go<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Pre-chorus</em></span><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Bridge</em></span><br>
You can cut us up but we will survive<br>
You had your chance now it's our time to stand up and rise<br>
I will survive<br>
Right now the tables turn<br>
We're gonna scream it out loud and let our voices be heard<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Outro</em></span><br>
I feel it in my heart when it all turns to dark<br>
Try to tear us apart but know that we'll wear our scars
