<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 1</em></span>  
Excuses, excuses are all that I hear  
All I can see when I look in the mirror  
I can't escape all these thoughts in my mind  
They're waiting to haunt me night after night  

I feel it in my bones and everything I know  
It's underneath my skin and it won't let go  
They know me all too well, but only time will tell  
If this is who I am, do I know myself?  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Pre-chorus</em></span>  
Don't forget your life's your own, don't ever let it go  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
In the heat of the moment, when fear has you frozen  
You're crashing and burning, when life's at its coldest  
Don't fall too far from who you are  
They can cut us but we'll wear our scars  
In the heat of the moment, when fear has you frozen  
You're crashing and burning, when life's at its coldest  
Don't fall too far from who you are  
Try to tear us apart but know that we'll wear our scars  
(Try to tear us apart but know that we'll wear our scars)  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 2</em></span>  
Denial, Denial is all that I've known  
Holding me hostage I'm never alone  
Fighting for air, I'll fight to survive  
My soul's not for sale I won't pay the price  
I feel it in my bones and everything I know  
It's underneath my skin but I won't let go  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Pre-chorus</em></span>  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Bridge</em></span>  
You can cut us up but we will survive  
You had your chance now it's our time to stand up and rise  
I will survive  
Right now the tables turn  
We're gonna scream it out loud and let our voices be heard  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Outro</em></span>  
I feel it in my heart when it all turns to dark  
Try to tear us apart but know that we'll wear our scars
