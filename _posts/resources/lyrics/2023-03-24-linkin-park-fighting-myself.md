<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse</em></span><br><br>
Now sometimes these thoughts in my head speak so loud<br>
Every little thing that I think about<br>
Just builds on top of the pain and doubt<br>
Even though I wanna just let it out<br>
I try to act like I don't mind it, try to keep my mouth so quiet<br>
But sittin' there in my silence just seems to amplify it<br>
<br>
When I thought that keepin' this inside would make it better<br>
I never thought that I would end up ruining it forever<br>
But every time I think I got everything put back together<br>
I end up making more regrets, making more regrets<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span><br><br>
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart<br>
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start<br>
Fighting myself, I always lose<br>
Fighting myself, I always lose<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 2</em></span><br><br>
I didn't want you to think I'm worn out so easily<br>
I wish I'd held it in so you never knew what built up inside of me<br>
Now I don't know how it overflowed, spilled out unwillingly<br>
But now everything that I learned to hate came out for you to see<br>
<br>
I don't want you to promise you can change everything and make it better<br>
'Cause you can bet I'm gonna end up ruining it forever<br>
And every time you think you got everything put back together<br>
I end up making more regrets, making more regrets<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus (x2)</em></span><br><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Bridge 1 (x2)</em></span><br><br>
I can't run with this weight on my back<br>
I can't see 'cause I'm focused on the past<br>
I can't breathe, I need to break free<br>
From the anger that is constantly inside me (inside of me)<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Bridge 2 (x2)</em></span><br><br>
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart<br>
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start<br>
I can't breathe, I need to break free<br>
From the anger that is constantly inside of me
