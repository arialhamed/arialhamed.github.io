<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 1 (Sigrid)</em></span><br>
Everyone's damaged<br>
A little depressed<br>
Every now and then we get that feeling in our chest<br>
Some days I'm a loser, brush my teeth in the dark<br>
Head above water in a swimming pool of sharks<br>
<br>
Ooh, it's hard to get up out of bed when everything is on its head<br>
And nothing seems to make any sense<br>
Like a Band-Aid on a bleeding heart<br>
I fake a smile and fall apart<br>
And no one ever knows I'm a wreck<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus (Sigrid)</em></span><br>
When the world is on your shoulders<br>
And the weight of your own heart is too much to bear<br>
Well, I know that you're afraid things will always be this way<br>
It's just a bad day, not a bad life<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 2 (Oli)</em></span><br>
Everything's backwards and I'm hanging on<br>
No matter how hard I try I always come undone<br>
Backed in a corner, uncomfortably numb<br>
Watching myself become a shadow of someone<br>
<br>
Oh, it's hard to find a place to hide<br>
When you're running from what's inside<br>
No matter where you go, there you are<br>
So tonight I'll go to war with me<br>
'Cause I'm my own worst enemy and I don't wanna fight anymore<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus (together)</em></span><br>
When the world is on your shoulders<br>
And the weight of your own heart is too much to bear<br>
Well, I know that you're afraid things will always be this way<br>
It's just a bad day, not a bad life<br>
And I know it feels so hopeless<br>
And I know how close you are to the edge right now<br>
So I wrote this song to say, things won't always be this way, no<br>
It's just a bad day, not a bad life<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Interlude (together)</em></span><br>
Ooh, yeah<br>
Yeah-yeah<br>
Yeah, oh<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus (together)</em></span><br>
When the world is on your shoulders<br>
And the weight of your own heart is too much to bear<br>
Well, I know that you're afraid things will always be this way<br>
It's just a bad day, not a bad life<br>
And I know it feels so hopeless<br>
And I know how close you are to the edge right now<br>
So I wrote this song to say, things won't always be this way, no<br>
It's just a bad day, not a bad life<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Outro (together)</em></span><br>
Yeah, it's just a bad day, not a bad life
