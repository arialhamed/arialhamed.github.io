<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 1 (Sigrid)</em></span>  
Everyone's damaged  
A little depressed  
Every now and then we get that feeling in our chest  
Some days I'm a loser, brush my teeth in the dark  
Head above water in a swimming pool of sharks  
  
Ooh, it's hard to get up out of bed when everything is on its head  
And nothing seems to make any sense  
Like a Band-Aid on a bleeding heart  
I fake a smile and fall apart  
And no one ever knows I'm a wreck  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus (Sigrid)</em></span>  
When the world is on your shoulders  
And the weight of your own heart is too much to bear  
Well, I know that you're afraid things will always be this way  
It's just a bad day, not a bad life  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 2 (Oli)</em></span>  
Everything's backwards and I'm hanging on  
No matter how hard I try I always come undone  
Backed in a corner, uncomfortably numb  
Watching myself become a shadow of someone  
  
Oh, it's hard to find a place to hide  
When you're running from what's inside  
No matter where you go, there you are  
So tonight I'll go to war with me  
'Cause I'm my own worst enemy and I don't wanna fight anymore  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus (together)</em></span>  
When the world is on your shoulders  
And the weight of your own heart is too much to bear  
Well, I know that you're afraid things will always be this way  
It's just a bad day, not a bad life  
And I know it feels so hopeless  
And I know how close you are to the edge right now  
So I wrote this song to say, things won't always be this way, no  
It's just a bad day, not a bad life  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Interlude (together)</em></span>  
Ooh, yeah  
Yeah-yeah  
Yeah, oh  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus (together)</em></span>  
When the world is on your shoulders  
And the weight of your own heart is too much to bear  
Well, I know that you're afraid things will always be this way  
It's just a bad day, not a bad life  
And I know it feels so hopeless  
And I know how close you are to the edge right now  
So I wrote this song to say, things won't always be this way, no  
It's just a bad day, not a bad life  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Outro (together)</em></span>  
Yeah, it's just a bad day, not a bad life
