Dear God, please, hear me out  
I know it's been a couple years  
Since I've reached out and said hello  
I bet You're wondering  
  
Why I keep  
Obsessing on and stressing all the little things  
When I should be  
Living life and soaking up the memories  
  
I know I've been selfish, I have  
No excuse to give you, it's true  
Hanging by a thread's how I live  
I don't know why, but I feel more comfortable  
  
Living in my agony, watching my self-esteem  
Go up in flames, acting like I don't  
Care what anyone else thinks, when I know truthfully  
That that's the furthest thing from how I  
  
Feel, but I'm too proud to open up and ask ya  
To pick me up and pull me out this hole I'm trapped in  
The truth is, I need help, but I just can't imagine who  
Who I'd be if I was happy  
  
Yeah, been this way so long  
It feels like something's off when I'm not depressed  
I got some issues that I won't address  
I got some baggage I ain't opened yet  
  
I got some demons I should put to rest  
I got some traumas that I can't forget  
I got some phone calls I been avoiding  
Some family members I don't really connect with  
  
Some things I said I wish I would of not let slip  
Some hurtful words that never should of left my lips  
Some bridges burned, I'm not ready to rebuild yet  
Some insecurities I haven't dealt with, yes  
  
I'll be the first to admit that I'm a lonely soul  
And the last to admit I need a hand to hold  
Losing hope, headed down a dangerous road  
Strange, I know, but I feel most at home when I'm  
  
Living in my agony, watching my self-esteem  
Go up in flames acting, like I don't  
Care what anyone else thinks, when I know truthfully  
That that's the furthest thing from how I  
  
Feel, but I'm too proud to open up and ask ya  
To pick me up and pull me out this hole I'm trapped in  
The truth is, I need help, but I just can't imagine who  
Who I'd be if I was happy  
  
Don't know what's around the bend  
Don't know what my future is  
But I can't keep on living in  
  
Living in my agony, watching my self-esteem  
Go up in flames acting, like I don't  
Care what anyone else thinks, when I know truthfully  
That that's the furthest thing from how I  
  
Feel, but I'm too proud to open up and ask ya  
To pick me up and pull me out this hole I'm trapped in  
The truth is, I need help, but I just can't imagine who  
Who I'd be if I was happy  
  
If I was happy  
  
If I was happy
