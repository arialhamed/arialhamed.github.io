<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse</em></span><br>
You shine brighter<br>
Than any star in the sky<br>
Your light shining<br>
Through the dark of the night<br>
Jesus forever<br>
I find all that I am<br>
In Your love, love, love<br>

You are with me<br>
In every step that I take<br>
Your love for me<br>
You have called me by name<br>
Jesus forever<br>
I find all that I am<br>
In Your love, love, love<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus 1</em></span><br>
Let the music play<br>
Hear us praise Your name<br>
See the darkness fade<br>
Dance the night away<br>
We have found our place<br>
In the Savior's grace<br>
Dance the night away<br>
Your light is taking over me<br>

I find freedom<br>

In Your love, love, love<br>
