<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse</em></span>  
You shine brighter  
Than any star in the sky  
Your light shining  
Through the dark of the night  
Jesus forever  
I find all that I am  
In Your love, love, love  

You are with me  
In every step that I take  
Your love for me  
You have called me by name  
Jesus forever  
I find all that I am  
In Your love, love, love  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus 1</em></span>  
Let the music play  
Hear us praise Your name  
See the darkness fade  
Dance the night away  
We have found our place  
In the Savior's grace  
Dance the night away  
Your light is taking over me  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 2</em></span>  
I find freedom  
In the light of Your love  
Everlasting  
You are more than enough  
Jesus forever  
I find all that I am  
In Your love, love, love
