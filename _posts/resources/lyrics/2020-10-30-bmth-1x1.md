<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Intro</em></span>  
Put me out of my misery

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 1</em></span>  
Disconnected from the world again  
And no, the sun don't shine in the place I've been  
So why you keep acting like I don't exist?  
Yeah, feel like I'm ready to die, but I can't commit  

So I ask myself, when will I learn?  
I'd set myself on fire to feel the burn  
I'm scared that I'm never gonna be repaired  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
Put me out of my misery  
My mind feels like an archenemy  
Can't look me in the eyes  
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go  
Reliving my memories, and they're killing me one by one  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 2 (ft. Nova Twins)</em></span>  
Sabotaged myself again  
Got a brain like a hurricane  
Me and that bitch, no, we can't be friends  
And I don't even care, no  

Got me sinking to a dark place (outta love)  
Evil twin under the staircase (oh my God)  
Think I'm looking at a long night  
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone  

Terrified (terrified), I'm numb (but I'm numb)  
Annihilation never looked so good, shut up  
Hush your mouth, you talk too much  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
Put me out of my misery  
My mind feels like an archenemy  
Can't look me in the eyes  
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go  
Reliving my memories, and they're killing me one by one  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Bridge</em></span>  
And I'm staring into the void again, no one knows what a mess I'm in  
The voices in my head say, "I'm just being paranoid"  
But it's bad for my health, how much I hate myself  
I suffocate, the weight, it pulls me underneath  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
Put me out of my misery  
My mind feels like an archenemy  
Can't look me in the eyes  
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go  
Reliving my memories, and they're killing me one by one  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Outro</em></span>  
Yeah, it's killing me one by one  
And they're killing me one by one
