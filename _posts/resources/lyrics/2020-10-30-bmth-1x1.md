<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Intro</em></span><br>
Put me out of my misery

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 1</em></span><br>
Disconnected from the world again<br>
And no, the sun don't shine in the place I've been<br>
So why you keep acting like I don't exist?<br>
Yeah, feel like I'm ready to die, but I can't commit<br>

So I ask myself, when will I learn?<br>
I'd set myself on fire to feel the burn<br>
I'm scared that I'm never gonna be repaired<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span><br>
Put me out of my misery<br>
My mind feels like an archenemy<br>
Can't look me in the eyes<br>
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go<br>
Reliving my memories, and they're killing me one by one<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 2 (ft. Nova Twins)</em></span><br>
Sabotaged myself again<br>
Got a brain like a hurricane<br>
Me and that bitch, no, we can't be friends<br>
And I don't even care, no<br>

Got me sinking to a dark place (outta love)<br>
Evil twin under the staircase (oh my God)<br>
Think I'm looking at a long night<br>
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone<br>

Terrified (terrified), I'm numb (but I'm numb)<br>
Annihilation never looked so good, shut up<br>
Hush your mouth, you talk too much<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span><br>
Put me out of my misery<br>
My mind feels like an archenemy<br>
Can't look me in the eyes<br>
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go<br>
Reliving my memories, and they're killing me one by one<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Bridge</em></span><br>
And I'm staring into the void again, no one knows what a mess I'm in<br>
The voices in my head say, "I'm just being paranoid"<br>
But it's bad for my health, how much I hate myself<br>
I suffocate, the weight, it pulls me underneath<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span><br>
Put me out of my misery<br>
My mind feels like an archenemy<br>
Can't look me in the eyes<br>
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go<br>
Reliving my memories, and they're killing me one by one<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Outro</em></span><br>
Yeah, it's killing me one by one<br>
And they're killing me one by one<br>
