<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 1</em></span>    
Watching Evangelion with a big fat slug of ketamine  
I lost the plot a little while ago, oh-oh  
My dog just died, my friends hate me  
I saw myself on MTV, and my ego is not my amigo (Yeah, yeah)  
Oh, maybe   
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Pre-Chorus</em></span>    
I don't belong on this planet  
Red crescent moons all over my hands  
It's too much to take, I can't understand it  
Someone tell me  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus 1</em></span>    
Why am I this way?  
Stupid medicine, not doin' anything  
What the hell is fucking wrong with me?  
I guess there's no remedy, I'm so terribly lost  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 2</em></span>    
Imaginary enemies, suicidal tendеncies  
Serotonin's proper on its arsе, oh-oh  
I used to go to therapy, but the doctor tried to section me  
The next time that I open up to someone will be my autopsy  
Because  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Pre-Chorus</em></span>    
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus 2</em></span>    
Why am I this way?  
Stupid medicine, not doin' anything  
What the hell is fucking wrong with me?  
I guess there's no remedy, own worst enemy  
I'm so terribly lost  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Bridge</em></span>    
If I keep this up  
I think I'm gonna break down  
If I keep this up  
I think I'm gonna break down  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Breakdown</em></span>    
Oh my God  
I think I'm gonna break down  
Oh my God  
I think I'm gonna break down  
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)  
I think I'm gonna break down  
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)  
Someone tell me  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus & Outro</em></span>    
Why am I this way?  
Stupid medicine, not doin' anything  
What the hell is fucking wrong with me?  
I guess there's no remedy, I'm so terribly lost  
Why am I this way?  
Stupid medicine, not doin' anything  
What the hell is fucking wrong with me?  
I guess there's no remedy, own worst enemy  
I'm so terribly lost
