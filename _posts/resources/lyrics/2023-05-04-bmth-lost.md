<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 1</em></span><br><br>
Watching Evangelion with a big fat slug of ketamine<br>
I lost the plot a little while ago, oh-oh<br>
My dog just died, my friends hate me<br>
I saw myself on MTV, and my ego is not my amigo (Yeah, yeah)<br>
Oh, maybe <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Pre-Chorus</em></span><br><br>
I don't belong on this planet<br>
Red crescent moons all over my hands<br>
It's too much to take, I can't understand it<br>
Someone tell me<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus 1</em></span><br><br>
Why am I this way?<br>
Stupid medicine, not doin' anything<br>
What the hell is fucking wrong with me?<br>
I guess there's no remedy, I'm so terribly lost<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 2</em></span><br><br>
Imaginary enemies, suicidal tendеncies<br>
Serotonin's proper on its arsе, oh-oh<br>
I used to go to therapy, but the doctor tried to section me<br>
The next time that I open up to someone will be my autopsy<br>
Because<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Pre-Chorus</em></span><br><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus 2</em></span><br><br>
Why am I this way?<br>
Stupid medicine, not doin' anything<br>
What the hell is fucking wrong with me?<br>
I guess there's no remedy, own worst enemy<br>
I'm so terribly lost<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Bridge</em></span><br><br>
If I keep this up<br>
I think I'm gonna break down<br>
If I keep this up<br>
I think I'm gonna break down<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Breakdown</em></span><br><br>
Oh my God<br>
I think I'm gonna break down<br>
Oh my God<br>
I think I'm gonna break down<br>
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)<br>
I think I'm gonna break down<br>
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)<br>
Someone tell me<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus & Outro</em></span><br><br>
Why am I this way?<br>
Stupid medicine, not doin' anything<br>
What the hell is fucking wrong with me?<br>
I guess there's no remedy, I'm so terribly lost<br>
Why am I this way?<br>
Stupid medicine, not doin' anything<br>
What the hell is fucking wrong with me?<br>
I guess there's no remedy, own worst enemy<br>
I'm so terribly lost
