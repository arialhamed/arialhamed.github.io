Hope  
Yeah, I'm on my way, I'm coming  
Don't, don't lose faith in me  
I know you've been waitin'  
I know you've been prayin' for my soul  
Hope, hope  
  
Thirty years you been draggin' your feet  
Tellin' me I'm the reason we're stagnant  
Thirty years you've been claiming you're honest  
And promising progress, well, where's it at?  
I don't want you to feel like a failure (failure)  
I know this hurts  
But I gave you your chance to deliver (deliver)  
Now it's my turn  
Don't get me wrong, Nate, you've had a great run  
But it's time to give the people somethin' different  
So without further ado, I'd  
Like to introduce my  
(My album, my album, my album, my album, my album, my album, my album)  
Hope  
What's my definition of success? (Of success)  
Listening to what your heart says (your heart says)  
Standing up for what you know is (is)  
Right, while everybody else is (is)  
Tucking their tail between their legs (okay)  
What's my definition of success? (Of success)  
Creating something no one else can (else can)  
Being brave enough to dream big (big)  
Grindin' when you're told to just quit (quit)  
Giving more when you got nothin' left (left)  
It's a person that'll take a chance on  
Something they were told could never happen  
It's a person that can see the bright side through the dark times when there ain't one  
It's when someone who ain't never had nothin'  
Ain't afraid to walk away from more profit  
'Cause they'd rather do somethin' that they really love and take the pay cut  
It's a person that would never waver  
Or change who they are  
Just to try and gain some credibility  
So they could feel accepted by a stranger  
It's a person that can take the failures in their life and turn them into motivation  
It's believing in yourself when no one else does, it's amazing  
  
What a little bit of faith can do if you don't even believe in you  
Why would you think or expect anybody else that's around you to?  
I done did things that I regret  
I done said things I can't take back  
Was a lost soul at a crossroad who had no hope but I changed that  
I spent years of my life holdin' on to things I never should've kept, full of hatred  
Years of my life carryin' a lot of baggage that I should've walked away from  
Years of my life wishin' I was someone different, lookin' for some validation  
Years of my life tryna fill the void, pretending I was in  
They get it  
  
Growing pain's a necessary evil  
Difficult to go through, yes, but beneficial  
Some would say having a mental breakdown is a negative thing  
Which on one hand, I agree with  
On the other hand, it was the push I needed  
To get help and start the healing process, see  
If I'd have never hit rock bottom  
Would I be the person that I am today?  
I don't believe so  
I'm a prime example of what happens when you choose to not accept defeat and face your demons  
Took me thirty years to realize that if you want to get the opportunity  
To be the greatest version of yourself  
Sometimes you got to be someone you're not to hear the voice of reason  
Having kids will make you really take a step back and look in the mirror  
At least for me that's what it did, I  
  
Wake up every day and pick my son up, hold him in my arms  
And let him know he's loved (loved)  
Standing by the window questioning if dad is ever going to show up (up)  
Isn't something he's gon' have to worry about  
Don't get it twisted, that wasn't a shot  
Mama, I forgive you  
I just don't want him to grow up thinkin' that he'll never be enough  
Thirty years of running, thirty years of searching  
Thirty years of hurting, thirty years of pain  
Thirty years of fearful, thirty years of anger  
Thirty years of empty, thirty years of shame  
Thirty years of broken, thirty years of anguish  
Thirty years of hopeless, thirty years of (hey)  
Thirty years of never, thirty years of maybe  
Thirty years of later, thirty years of fake  
Thirty years of hollow, thirty years of sorrow  
Thirty years of darkness, thirty years of (Nate)  
Thirty years of baggage, thirty years of sadness  
Thirty years of stagnant, thirty years of chains  
Thirty years of anxious, thirty years of suffering  
Thirty years of torment, thirty years of (wait)  
Thirty years of bitter, thirty years of lonely  
Thirty years of pushing everyone away  
(You'll never evolve) I know I can change  
(We are not enough) we are not the same  
(You don't have the heart) you don't have the strength  
(You don't have the will) you don't have the faith  
(You'll never be loved, you'll never be safe  
Might as well give up) not running away  
(You don't have the guts) you're the one afraid  
I'm the one in charge  
I'm taking the (no)  
I'm taking the  
Reigns
