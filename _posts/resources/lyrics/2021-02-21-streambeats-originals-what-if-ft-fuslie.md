<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Verse 1: Ryan King</span>  
Have I become a little too shy for love?  
I've been hurt before  
"All's fair in love and war"  
So, I snuggle up close to the shell I'm living in  
And if I let you in  
Another round begins  
I know  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pre-Chorus: Ryan King</span>  
I'm spinning in a vicious cycle  
I'm scared of doing something I'll regret  
Maybe this is right  
But I'm still staring at your silhouette  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Chorus: Ryan King</span>  
What if you're everything I need?  
A fire in my heart, the air I breathe  
What if I'm incomplete without you by my side?  
What if I go against my heart?  
Instead of confessing from the start  
What if I miss out on the life meant for us?  
I need you by my sidе  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Verse 2: Fuslie</span>  
Should I be scared? The feeling's so diffеrent now  
You got me floating here  
A feather in the air, oh  
But when the wind blows, will I tumble or sail away?  
Or would you have me stay?  
And what if I escape?  
I know  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pre-Chorus: Ryan King & Fuslie</span>  
I'm spinning in a vicious cycle  
I'm scared of doing something I'll regret  
Maybe this is right  
But I'm still staring at your silhouette  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Chorus: Ryan King & Fuslie</span>  
What if you're everything I need?  
A fire in my heart, the air I breathe  
What if I'm incomplete without you by my side?  
What if I go against my heart?  
Instead of confessing from the start  
What if I miss out on the life meant for us?  
I need you by my side  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Bridge: Ryan King, <em>Fuslie</em>, <b>Ryan King & Fuslie</b></span>  
By your side (<em>By your side</em>)  
I'm not afraid (<em>I'm not afraid</em>)  
<b>We found something that'll never fade</b>  
<b>We can be ourselves and figure out the rest along the way</b>  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Chorus: Ryan King & Fuslie, <em>Fuslie</em></span>  
What if you're everything I need?  
A fire in my heart, the air I breathe  
What if I'm incomplete without you by my side?  
What if I go against my heart?  
Instead of confessing from the start  
What if I miss out on the life meant for us?  
I need you by my side (<em>I need you by my side</em>)  
I need you by my side
