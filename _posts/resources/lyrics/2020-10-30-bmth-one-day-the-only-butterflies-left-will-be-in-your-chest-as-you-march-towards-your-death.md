<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 1</em></span>  
On the verge of no return, why'd you keep sugaring it up?  
Don't wanna have to bury you, but nothing seems to get through your skull  
One day, the only butterflies left will be in your chest  
As you march towards your death, breathing your last breath  
I hate to say, "I told you so", but look how the bruises show  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
Tell me, how is it gonna feel without my arms wrapped around, wrapped around you?  
Bet it feels pretty real when your skin starts to peel from the bone  
You were dead to the world, now I'm dead to you  
Haunting your own house, nothing to lose  
How did I let you sink your fangs so deep? Ah  
You know you can't breathe on your own  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 2</em></span>  
Past the point of rescuing, why'd I keep pushing my luck?  
The hole I wore into your soul has got too big to overlook  
One day, the only butterflies left will be in our chests  
As we march towards our death, breathing our last breath  
I thought we had a future, but we ain't got a chance in hell  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
So tell me, how is it gonna feel without my arms wrapped around, wrapped around you?  
Bet it feels pretty real when your skin starts to peel from the bone  
You were dead to the world, now I'm dead to you  
Haunting your own house, nothing to lose  
I let you sink your fangs so deep, ah  
You know you can't breathe on your own  
How can you breathe on your own?  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Outro</em></span>  
The sun is setting on our love, I fear  
Letting our loneliness out into the atmosphere  
The tides have turned in on our chance to turn it 'round  
I never thought I'd see my fingernails fall out  
Love isn't in the air, love isn't in the air  
Love isn't in the air, love isn't in the air
