<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 1</em></span><br>
On the verge of no return, why'd you keep sugaring it up?<br>
Don't wanna have to bury you, but nothing seems to get through your skull<br>
One day, the only butterflies left will be in your chest<br>
As you march towards your death, breathing your last breath<br>
I hate to say, "I told you so", but look how the bruises show<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span><br>
Tell me, how is it gonna feel without my arms wrapped around, wrapped around you?<br>
Bet it feels pretty real when your skin starts to peel from the bone<br>
You were dead to the world, now I'm dead to you<br>
Haunting your own house, nothing to lose<br>
How did I let you sink your fangs so deep? Ah<br>
You know you can't breathe on your own<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse 2</em></span><br>
Past the point of rescuing, why'd I keep pushing my luck?<br>
The hole I wore into your soul has got too big to overlook<br>
One day, the only butterflies left will be in our chests<br>
As we march towards our death, breathing our last breath<br>
I thought we had a future, but we ain't got a chance in hell<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span><br>
So tell me, how is it gonna feel without my arms wrapped around, wrapped around you?<br>
Bet it feels pretty real when your skin starts to peel from the bone<br>
You were dead to the world, now I'm dead to you<br>
Haunting your own house, nothing to lose<br>
I let you sink your fangs so deep, ah<br>
You know you can't breathe on your own<br>
How can you breathe on your own?<br>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Outro</em></span><br>
The sun is setting on our love, I fear<br>
Letting our loneliness out into the atmosphere<br>
The tides have turned in on our chance to turn it 'round<br>
I never thought I'd see my fingernails fall out<br>
Love isn't in the air, love isn't in the air<br>
Love isn't in the air, love isn't in the air<br>
