<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse</em></span>  
You know you need a fix when you fall down  
You know you need to find a way  
To get you through another day  
Let me be the one to numb you out  
Let me be the one to hold you  
Never gonna let you get away  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Pre-chorus</em></span>  
The shoulder you cry on  
The dose that you die on  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer  
You'll love me 'til it's all over, over  
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on  
The dose that you die on  
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse</em></span>  
I know what you want so desperately  
You know I'll give you one for free  
Forever you're coming back to me  
Now, I'm gonna give you what you need  
'Cause I know what you fiend on and what you lean on  
And what you lean on  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Pre-chorus</em></span>  
The shoulder you cry on  
The dose that you die on  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer  
You'll love me 'til it's all over, over  
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on  
The dose that you die on  
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Bridge</em></span>  
Did you find another cure?  
Did you find another cure?  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer  
You'll love me 'til it's all over, over  
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on  
The dose that you die on  
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
