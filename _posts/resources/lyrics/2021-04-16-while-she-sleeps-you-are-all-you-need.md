<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse</em></span>  
Brain damage, deterioration, this hurt won't speak for me  
Divided in disbelief, the hairline fractures split beneath  
We all deserve to suffocate  
Can anybody hear me?  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
I'd rather be underrated, the minor not the major  
I don't need liberation, a higher state of being  
I'd rather be hated, cursed instead of sacred  
We're gonna set the record straight, no hidden fucking meaning  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Verse</em></span>  
So far so bad and it's only getting worse  
There ain't no distance between hell and earth  
We all deserve to suffocate  
But the world still turns (I'd rather be)  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Chorus</em></span>  
Underrated, the minor not the major  
I don't need liberation, a higher state of being  
I'd rather be hated, cursed instead of sacred  
We're gonna set the record straight, no hidden fucking meaning  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Bridge</em></span>  
Substitute this feeling with something I don't need  
I'd rather suffer than believe and not feel  
If only we could choose the reasons we refuse to sleep  
Find the proof that you are all you need  
  
I'm trying to get through to you but the route won't take me  
Just loops back to feed the wounds that define our actions, underhand them  
Fake the news and betray our minds of understanding  
When will we refuse?  
I'm trying to get  
Out  
(I'm trying to get out)  
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Outro</em></span>  
When the sun burns out will it all be worth it?  
Will the stars fall down into you?  
No one knows
